Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God s chosen people and the knowledge of the truth that agrees with godliness
with the certain hope of everlasting life that God who does not lie promised before all the ages of time
At the right time he revealed his word by the message that he trusted me to deliver I was to do this by the command of God our savior
To Titus a true son in our common faith Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior
For this purpose I left you in Crete that you might set in order things not yet complete and ordain elders in every city as I directed you
An elder must be without blame the husband of one wife with faithful children not accused of reckless behavior or undisciplined
It is necessary for the overseer as God s household manager to be blameless He must not be arrogant not be easily angered not addicted to wine not a brawler and not a greedy man
Instead he should be hospitable and a friend of what is good He must be sensible righteous godly and self controlled
He should hold tightly to the trustworthy message that was taught so that he may be able to encourage others with good teaching and correct those who oppose him
For there are many rebellious people empty talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision
It is necessary to stop them They are breaking up whole families by teaching for shameful profit what they should not teach
One of their own prophets has said Cretans are always liars evil beasts lazy gluttons
This statement is true Therefore correct them severely so that they may be sound in the faith
not paying any attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of people who turn away from the truth
To those who are pure all things are pure But to those who are corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure but both their minds and their consciences have been corrupted
They profess to know God but they deny him by their actions They are detestable disobedient and unfit for doing any good work

But you speak what fits with faithful instruction
Teach older men to be temperate dignified sensible sound in faith in love and in perseverance
Teach older women likewise to be reverent in behavior not slanderers or being slaves to much wine but to be teachers of what is good
In this way they may train the younger women to love their own husbands and children
to be sensible pure good housekeepers and obedient to their own husbands They should do these things so that God s word may not be insulted
In the same way encourage the younger men to use good sense
In all ways present yourself as an example of good works In your teaching show integrity dignity
and a correct message so that anyone who opposes you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us
Teach slaves to obey their masters in everything to please them and not argue with them
to not steal from them but instead to demonstrate all good faith so that in every way they may bring credit to the teaching about God our Savior
For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all people
It trains us to reject godlessness and worldly passions and to live self controlled upright and godly lives in this age
while we look forward to receiving our blessed hope the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ
Jesus gave himself for us in order to redeem us from all lawlessness and to make pure for himself a special people who are eager to do good works
Speak of these things encourage people to do them and give correction with all authority Let no one disregard you

Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities to obey them to be ready for every good work
to revile no one to not be eager to fight and to be gentle showing all humility toward everyone
For once we ourselves were thoughtless and disobedient We were led astray and enslaved by various passions and pleasures We lived in evil and envy We were detestable and hated one another
But when the kindness of God our savior and his love for mankind appeared
it was not by works of righteousness that we did but by his mercy that he saved us He saved us through the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit
God richly poured the Holy Spirit on us through our Savior Jesus Christ
so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs with the certain hope of eternal life
This message is trustworthy I want you to insist on these things so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage themselves in good works These things are good and useful for everyone
But avoid foolish debates and genealogies and strife and conflict about the law Those things are unprofitable and worthless
Reject anyone who is causing divisions among you after one or two warnings
knowing that such a person has turned from the right way and is sinning and condemns himself
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you hurry and come to me at Nicopolis where I have decided to spend the winter
Do everything you can to send on their way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos so that they lack nothing
Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that provide for urgent needs and so not be unfruitful
All those who are with me greet you Greet those who love us in faith Grace be with all of you
