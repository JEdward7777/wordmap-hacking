BLB - Berean Literal Bible
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begat Perez and Zerah out of Tamar, and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram.
And Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon.
And Salmon begat Boaz out of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed out of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,
and Jesse begat David the king. Next: David begat Solomon, out of the wife of Uriah,
and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah.
And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amos, and Amos begat Josiah,
and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.
And after the carrying away to Babylon: Jechoniah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,
and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor.
And Azor begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud.
And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, the One being called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ came about in this way: His mother Mary, having been pledged to Joseph, before their coming together, was found holding in womb through the Holy Spirit.
Then Joseph her husband, being righteous and not willing to shame her publicly, resolved to divorce her quietly.
But on his having pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, you should not be afraid to receive Mary as your wife, for that having been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
And she will bring forth a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”
And all this has come to pass, so that it may be fulfilled that having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
“Behold, the virgin will hold in womb, and will bring forth a son, and they will call His name Immanuel” which is, being translated, “God with us.”
And Joseph, having been awoken from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and received his wife.
But he did not know her until she had brought forth a Son, and he called His name Jesus.
Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
saying, “Where is the One having been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.”
And King Herod having heard this, was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
And having assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring of them where the Christ was to be born.
And they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus has it been written through the prophet:
‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come forth One leading, who will shepherd My people Israel.’”
Then Herod, having called the Magi secretly, inquired of them the exact time of the star appearing.
And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, “Having gone, search carefully for the Child; and when You shall have found Him, bring word back to me, so that I also having come, may worship Him.”
And having heard the king, they departed. And behold, the star they had seen in the east went before them until, having arrived, it stood over the place where the Child was.
And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
And having come into the house, they found the Child with His mother Mary, and having fallen down, they worshiped Him. And having opened their treasures, they offered to Him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
And having been divinely warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew into their own country by another route.
And of them having withdrawn, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream saying, “Having arisen, take the Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I should tell you, for Herod is about to seek the Child to destroy Him.”
And having arisen, he took the Child and His mother by night and withdrew into Egypt,
and there he remained until the death of Herod, so that it might be fulfilled what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I have called my Son.”
Then Herod, having seen that he had been outwitted by the Magi, was intensely enraged. And having sent forth, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its vicinity from two years old and under, according to the time he had ascertained from the Magi.
Then was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, saying:
“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she would not be comforted, because they are not.”
But of Herod having died, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
saying, “Having arisen, take the Child and His mother and go into the land of Israel; for those seeking the life of the Child have died.”
And having arisen, he took the Child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.
And having heard that Archelaus reigns over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew into the district of Galilee.
And having come, he dwelt in a city being called Nazareth, so that it should be fulfilled that having been spoken through the prophets, that “He will be called a Nazarene.”
Now in those days John the Baptist comes, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”
For this is the one having been spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.’”
And John himself had his garment of camel’s hair, and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
At that time were going out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan,
and confessing their sins, were being baptized by him in the Jordan River.
But having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance.
And do not presume to say within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that out of these stones God is able to raise up children unto Abraham.
Already now the ax is applied to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but after me is coming He who is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to carry the sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,
whose winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will clear His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.
But John was hindering Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?”
But Jesus answering, said unto him, “Permit it presently; for thus it is fitting to us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permits Him.
And immediately, having been baptized, Jesus went up from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and alighting upon Him.
And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, “This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I was well pleased.”
Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.
And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.
And the one tempting, having come to Him, said “If You are Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread.”
But answering He said, “It has been written: ‘The man shall live not by bread alone, but by every word coming out of the mouth of God.’”
Then the devil takes Him to the holy city and sets Him upon the pinnacle of the temple,
and says to him, “If You are Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it has been written: ‘He will give orders to His angels concerning You, and will they bear You up in their hands, lest ever You strike Your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus said to him, “Again it has been written: ‘You shall not test the Lord your God.’”
Again the devil takes Him to a mountain exceedingly high and shows to Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he says to Him, “All these things I will give to You, if falling down, You will worship me.”
Then Jesus says to him, “Get you away, Satan! For it has been written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone shall you serve.’”
Then the devil leaves Him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to Him.
And having heard that John had been arrested, He withdrew into Galilee.
And having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum, on the sea-side in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying:
“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and to those sitting in the land and shadow of death, a light has dawned on them.”
From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!”
Now walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And He says to them, “Come follow after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
And immediately having left the nets, they followed Him.
And having gone on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And He called them,
and immediately having left the boat and their father they followed Him.
And He was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
And the news of Him went out into all Syria. And they brought to Him all the sick having various diseases and oppressing pains, and being possessed by demons, and having seizures, and paralytics—and He healed them.
And there followed Him great crowds from Galilee, and the Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
And having seen the crowds, He went up on the mountain. And He having sat down, His disciples came to Him,
and opening His mouth, He was teaching them, saying:
“Blessed are the poor in the spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
Blessed are those mourning, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.
Blessed are those having been persecuted on account of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
Blessed are you when they shall insult you and shall persecute you, and lying shall say all kinds of evil against you on account of Me.
Rejoice and exult, because great is your reward in the heavens; for thus they persecuted the prophets before you.
You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what will it be salted. For nothing is it potent any longer except, having been cast out, to be trampled upon by men.
You are the light of the world. A city lying on a hill is unable to be hidden.
Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but upon the lampstand, and it gives light to all those in the house.
Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and they should glorify your Father in the heavens.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth shall pass away, not even one iota, nor one stroke of a letter, shall pass away from the law, until everything should happen.
Whoever then shall break one of the least of these commandments and shall teach others the same, he will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever shall keep and shall teach them, he will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
For I say to you that unless your righteousness shall abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You shall not murder’ and ‘Whoever shall murder will be liable to the judgment.’
But I say to you that everyone being angry with his brother will be liable to the judgment, and whoever shall say to his brother ‘Raca,’ will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever shall say, ‘Fool!’ will be liable to the Gehenna of fire.
Therefore, if you shall offer your gift at the altar, and there shall remember that your brother has something against you,
leave your gift there before the altar and first go away, be reconciled to your brother; and then having come, offer your gift.
Be agreeing quickly with your accuser while you are on the way with him, lest ever the accuser deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you will be cast into prison.
Truly I say to you, you shall not come out from there until you should pay the last kodranten!
You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’
But I say to you that everyone looking upon a woman in order to lust after her already has committed adultery with her in his heart.
And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. For it is better for you that one of your members should perish and not that your whole body should be cast into Gehenna.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you, for it is better for you that one of your members should perish and not that your whole body should depart into Gehenna.
It was also said, ‘Whoever shall divorce his wife, let him give her a letter of divorce.’
But I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever shall marry her who has been divorced commits adultery.
Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but you shall keep your oaths to the Lord.’
But I say to you not to swear at all: neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God;
nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
Neither shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.
But let your statement ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and ‘No,’ ‘No.’ Anything more than these comes from evil.
You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’
But I tell you not to resist the evil person. Instead, whoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And to the one willing to sue you and to take your tunic, yield to him the cloak as well.
And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go with him two.
Give to the one asking of you, and you shall not turn away from the one desiring to borrow from you.
You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those persecuting you,
so that you may be sons of your Father in the heavens. For He makes His sun rise on evil and good, and He sends rain on righteous and unrighteous.
For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
And if you greet only your brothers, what extraordinary are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
You shall be perfect, therefore, as your Heavenly Father is perfect.
And beware not to do your righteousness before men in order to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward in the presence of your Father in the heavens.
Therefore when you perform acts of charity, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Truly I say to you, they have their recompense.
But you, doing acts of charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, the One seeing in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets so that they might be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their recompense.
But you when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father, the One in secret. And your Father, the One seeing in secret, will reward you.
And praying, do not use vain repetitions like the pagans, for they think that in their many words they will be heard.
Therefore do not be like to them, for your Father knows of what things you have need before your asking Him.
Therefore pray you like this: ‘Our Father in the heavens, hallowed be Your name!
Your kingdom come. Your will be done as in heaven, so also upon earth.
Our daily bread, grant us today.
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
And whenever you fast, do not be downcast in countenance like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they might appear to men as fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their recompense.
But you fasting, anoint your head and wash your face,
so that you might not appear to men as fasting, but to your Father, the One in secret. And your Father, the One seeing in secret, will reward you.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroy, and where thieves do not break in nor steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and he will love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and he will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and mammon.
Because of this I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor your body, what you should put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow nor do they reap, nor do they gather into barns, and your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
And who of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his stature?
And why do you worry about clothing? Consider carefully how the lilies of the field grow: They do not labor nor do they spin.
Yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these.
But if God thus clothes the grass of the field, existing today and tomorrow being thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ Or ‘What shall we drink?’ Or ‘What shall we wear?’
For the Gentiles seek after all these things. For your Heavenly Father knows that you have need of them all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Sufficient to the day is its own trouble.
Do not judge, lest you should be judged.
For with that verdict you pronounce, you will be judged; and with that measure you measure, it will be measured to you.
And why do you look at the splinter in your brother’s eye, but not notice the beam in your own eye?
Or how shall you say to your brother, ‘Permit that I might cast out the splinter from your eye,’ and behold, the beam is in your eye?
Hypocrite! First cast out the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the splinter from the eye of your brother.
Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the pigs, lest they shall trample upon them with their feet, and having turned, tear you to pieces.
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened unto you.
For everyone asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking, it will be opened.
Or which man is among you who, if his son will ask for bread, will give him a stone?
Or also, if he will ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?
Therefore, if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in the heavens give good things to those asking Him!
All things therefore, as many as you might desire that men should do to you, so also you do to them, for this is the law and the prophets.
Enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad the way leading to destruction, and many are those entering through it.
For small is the gate and narrow the way leading to life, and few are those finding it.
Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
By their fruits you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
So every good tree bears good fruits, but the rotten tree bears bad fruits.
A good tree is not able to bear bad fruits, nor a bad tree to bear good fruits.
Every tree not bearing good fruit is cut down and is thrown into fire.
Then surely by their fruits you will recognize them.
Not everyone saying to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of My Father in the heavens.
Many will say to Me in that the day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’
And then I will declare unto them, ‘I never knew you; depart you from Me, those working lawlessness.’
Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock.
And the rain came down, and the torrents came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it did not fall, for its foundation had been lain upon the rock.
And everyone hearing these words of Mine and not acting on them, he will be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.
And the rain came down, and the torrents came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell—and great was its collapse!”
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at His teaching.
for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
And He having come down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
And behold a leper having come, was worshipping Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You are able to cleanse me.”
And having stretched out the hand, He touched him saying, “I am willing; be you cleansed!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
And Jesus says to him, “See that you tell no one. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”
And He having entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him,
and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”
And He says to him, “I having come, will heal him.”
But the centurion answering, said, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
And Jesus having heard, marveled and said to those following, “Truly I say to you, no one in Israel with faith so great have I found.
And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.
But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.”
And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you have believed, be it to you.” And his servant was healed in that very hour.
And Jesus having come to the house of Peter, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick and fevering.
And He touched her hand and the fever left her; and she arose and was ministering unto them.
And evening having come, they brought to Him many being possessed with demons, and He cast out the spirits with a word and He healed all those being sick,
so that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying, “He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”
And Jesus, having seen a great crowd around Him, gave orders to depart to the other side.
And one scribe, having approached Him, said “Teacher, I will follow You wherever that You should go.”
And Jesus says to him, “Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere He might lay the head.”
And another of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, allow me first to go and to bury my father.”
But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”
And He having entered into the boat, His disciples followed Him.
And behold, a great storm arose in the sea so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but He Himself was sleeping.
And having approached, they awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us, we are perishing!”
And He says to them, “O you of little faith, Why are you afraid?” Then having arisen, He rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”
And He having come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two being possessed by demons met Him, coming forth out of the tombs, extremely violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.
And behold, they cried out saying, “What to us and to you Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”
Now there was far off from them a herd of many pigs feeding.
And the demons were begging Him, saying, “If You cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs.”
And He said to them, “Go!” And having gone out, they went away into the pigs, and behold, all the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.
And those feeding them fled, and having gone away into the city, they related everything, including the matter of those being possessed by demons.
And behold, all the city went out to meet Jesus. And having seen Him, they begged Him that He would depart from their region.
And having entered into a boat, He passed over and came to the own city.
And behold, they were bringing to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. And Jesus, having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son; your sins have been forgiven.”
And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This one blasphemes!”
And Jesus, having known their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?
For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” Then He says to the paralytic, “Having arisen, take up your mat and go to your house.”
And having arisen, he went away to his house.
And the crowds having seen, marveled and glorified God, the One having given such authority to men.
And Jesus passing on from there saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth. And He says to him, “Follow Me.” And having arisen, he followed Him.
And it came to pass, of Him reclining in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners having come, were reclining with Jesus and His disciples.
And having seen it, the Pharisees said to His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?”
And having heard, He said, “Not those being strong have need of a physician, but those being sick.
But having gone, learn what is, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”
Then the disciples of John come to Him saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”
And Jesus said to them, “Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then they will fast.
But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on old clothing, for the filling up of it tears away from the garment, and a worse tear emerges.
Nor do they pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wineskins are burst, and the wine is poured out, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”
Of Him speaking these things to them, behold, a certain ruler having come, was kneeling down to Him, saying, “My daughter presently has died; but having come, lay Your hand upon her, and she will live.”
And having arisen, Jesus followed him, also His disciples.
And behold a woman having had a flux of blood twelve years, having come up behind Him, touched the fringe of His garment.
For she was saying within herself, “If only I shall touch His garment, I will be healed.”
And Jesus, having turned and having seen her said, “Take courage, daughter. Your faith has cured you.” And the woman was cured from that very hour.
And Jesus having come into the ruler’s house and having seen the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
He says, “Go away, for the girl is not dead, but sleeps.” And they began to laugh at Him.
And when the crowd had been put outside, having entered, He took hold of her hand, and the girl arose.
And this report went out into all that land.
And Jesus passing on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David.”
And having come into the house, the blind men came to Him, and Jesus says to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They say to him, “Yes, Lord.”
Then He touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith be it to you.”
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly instructed them, saying, “See that no one knows!”
But having gone out, they made Him known in all that land.
And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a mute man, possessed by a demon.
And the demon having been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, “Never thus was it seen in Israel.”
But the Pharisees were saying, “By the prince of the demons He casts out demons.”
And Jesus was going throughout all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.
And having seen the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were wearied and cast away, as sheep not having a shepherd.
Then He says to His disciples, “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the workmen are few.
Beseech the Lord of the harvest, therefore, that He might send out workmen into His harvest.”
And having summoned His twelve disciples, He gave to them authority over unclean spirits, so as to cast them out and to heal every disease and every sickness.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon called Peter, and his brother Andrew; and James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus;
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one also having betrayed Him.
These twelve, Jesus sent forth, having instructed them, saying: “Do not go into the way of the Gentiles and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.
But go rather to those being the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And going on, proclaim, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!’
Heal the ailing, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons! Freely you received; freely give.
Take along neither gold nor silver nor copper in your belts,
nor provision-bag for the way, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the workman is worthy of his provisions.
And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it. Remain there until you go forth.
And entering into the house, greet it.
And if indeed the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
And whoever will not receive you nor will hear your words, shake off the dust of your feet going forth out of that house or that city!
Truly I say to you, on the day of judgment, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and of Gomorrah than for that city.
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves.
But beware of men; for they will deliver you into the courts and they will flog you in their synagogues.
And you will be brought also before governors and kings on account of Me, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
And when they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what you should speak; for in that hour you will be given what you should say,
for you are not those speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father, child; and children will rise up against parents and will put them to death.
And you will be hated by all on account of My name; but the one having endured to the end, he will be saved.
And whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next. For truly I say to you, you shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.
It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the master of the house they called Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!
Therefore you should not fear them! For nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops!
And you should not be afraid of those killing the body but not being able to kill the soul. Indeed rather you should fear the One being able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
And even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Therefore you should not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.
Therefore everyone who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father in the heavens.
And whoever shall deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father in the heavens.
Do not think that I came to bring peace to the earth; I came not to bring peace, but a sword.
For I came to set at variance ‘A man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,
and the enemies of the man are his own household.’
The one loving father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me, and the one loving son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me.
And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
The one having found his life will lose it, and the one having lost his life on account of Me will find it.
The One receiving you receives Me, and the one receiving Me receives the One having sent Me.
The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet, and the one receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive the reward of a righteous man.
And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall certainly not lose his reward.”
And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.
And John, having heard in prison the works of the Christ, having sent two of his disciples,
said to Him, “Are You the coming One, or are we to look for another?”
And Jesus answering, said to them, “Having gone, relate to John what you hear and see:
The blind receive sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor are gospelized.
And blessed is he who shall not fall away in Me.”
And as these were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what did you go out to see? A man having been dressed in delicate clothing? Behold, those wearing delicate clothing are in kings’ houses.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one more excellent than a prophet.
For this is he about whom it has been written: ‘Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.’
Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he!
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence and the violent seize it.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, the one being about to come.
The one having ears, let him hear!
But to what will I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the markets and calling out to others,
saying: ‘We piped for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge and you did not wail.’
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her deeds.”
Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had taken place, because they did not repent.
“Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! For if the miracles having taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, then they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I say to you, in the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, but will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles having taken place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you that in day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you.”
At that time, Jesus answering said, “I fully consent to You, Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, that You did hide these things from the wise and learned, and did reveal them to little children.
Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing before You.
All things have been delivered to Me by My Father. And no one knows the Son, except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and to whom the Son might choose to reveal Him.
Come to Me, all those toiling and being burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbaths, and His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck the heads of grain and to eat them.
And the Pharisees, having seen, said to Him, “Behold, Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on Sabbath.”
And He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those with him—
how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the loaves of the presentation, which it was not lawful for him nor for those with him to eat, but only for the priests?
Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?
But I say to you that a greater than the temple is here.
But if you had known what this is, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ then you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
And having departed from there, He went into their synagogue.
And behold, a man having a withered hand, and they asked Him saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbaths?”—so that they might accuse Him.
And He said to them, “What man will there be among you, who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbaths, will not take hold of it and will raise it up?
How much more valuable therefore is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbaths.”
Then He says to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored, as sound as the other.
And the Pharisees having gone out, held a counsel against Him, how they might destroy Him.
And Jesus having known, withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all,
and He warned them that they should not make Him known—
so that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying:
“Behold My servant, whom I have chosen, My beloved, in whom My soul has found delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
He will not quarrel nor will he cry out; nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not quench, until He leads justice to victory.
And in His name the Gentiles will hope.”
Then was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, and He healed him, in order for the mute man to speak and to see.
And all the crowds were amazed, and were saying, “Could this be the son of David?”
And the Pharisees having heard, said, “This man casts out the demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”
And having known their thoughts, He said to them, “Every kingdom having been divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house having been divided against itself will not stand.
And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? On account of this, they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong man, and to plunder his goods, unless first he binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.
The one not being with Me is against Me, and the one not gathering with Me scatters.
Because of this I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men; but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
And if anyone speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but if anyone speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the coming one.
Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad. For the tree is known by the fruit.
Offspring of vipers, how are you able to speak good things, being evil? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
The good man out of his good treasure puts forth good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure puts forth evil things.
And I say to you that every careless word that they will speak, men will give an account of it in day of judgment.
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.”
And answering He said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this the generation and will condemn it. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Now when the unclean spirit is gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it.
Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from where I came out.’ And having come, it finds it being unoccupied, and swept, and put in order.
Then it goes and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself; and having entered in, they dwell there, and the last of that the man becomes worse than the first. So also will it be unto this evil generation.”
Now while He was speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him.
Then someone said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to You.”
And answering, He said to the one telling Him, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?”
And having stretched out His hand to His disciples, He said, “Behold, My mother and My brothers.
For whoever shall do the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother.”
In that same day, Jesus, having gone forth from the house, was sitting by the sea.
And great crowds were gathered together to Him, so that He having entered into a boat, sat down, and all the crowd stood on the shore.
And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, “Behold, the one sowing went out to sow.
And in his sowing, indeed some fell along the road, and the birds having come, devoured them.
And other fell upon the rocky places where it did not have much soil. And it sprang up immediately, through having no depth of soil.
And the sun having risen, they were scorched, and through not having root, were dried up.
And other fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
And other fell upon the good soil and were yielding fruit—indeed some a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.
The one having ears, let him hear!”
And the disciples having approached, said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”
And answering He said to them, “Because it has been granted to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been granted.
For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will be in abundance. And whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
Because of this I speak to them in parables: ‘Because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.’
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, saying: ‘In hearing you will hear and never understand; and in seeing you will see and never perceive.
For the heart of this people has grown dull, and they barely hear with the ears, and they have closed their eyes, lest ever they should see with the eyes, and they should hear with the ears, and they should understand with the heart, and should turn, and I will heal them.’
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.
You, therefore, hear the parable of the one having sown:
Everyone hearing the word of the kingdom and not understanding, the evil one comes and snatches away that having been sown in his heart. This is the one having been sown on the path.
And the one having been sown upon the rocky places, this is the one hearing the word and immediately receiving it with joy.
And he has in himself no root, but is temporary. And having come tribulation or persecution on account of the word, immediately he falls away.
And the one having been sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the care of this present age and the deceit of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
But the one having been sown on the good soil, this is the one hearing the word and understanding, who indeed brings forth fruit and produces—indeed, some a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.”
He put before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man having sown good seed in his field.
And while the men are sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds in the midst of the wheat, and went away.
And when the plants sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.
And the servants, having approached the master of the house, said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’
And he said to them, ‘An enemy did this.’ And the servants said to him, ‘Then do you desire that having gone forth, we should gather them?’
And he said, ‘No, lest gathering the weeds, you would uproot the wheat with them.
Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the harvesters, “First gather the weeds, and bind them into bundles in order to burn them; then gather together the wheat into my barn.”’”
He put before them another parable, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man having taken, sowed in his field,
which indeed is smallest of all the seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the garden plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and encamp in its branches.”
He spoke to them another parable: “The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables, and He was not speaking to them without a parable,
so that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet, saying: “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”
Then having dismissed the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.”
And answering He said, “The One sowing the good seed is the Son of Man;
and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil one;
and the enemy having sown them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the harvesters are angels.
Therefore, as the weeds are gathered and consumed in fire, so will it be in the consummation of the age.
The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and those practicing lawlessness,
and they will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one having ears, let him hear!
The kingdom of the heavens is like treasure having been hidden in the field, which a man having found, hid. And for joy over it, he goes and he sells all that he has, and buys that field.
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
And having found one very precious pearl, having gone away, he has sold all things as many as he had, and bought it.
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet having been cast into the sea, and having gathered together of every kind,
which when it was filled, they having drawn it up on the shore and having sat down, collected the good into vessels, and they cast out the bad.
Thus will it be in the consummation of the age: The angels will go out and will separate the evil from the midst of the righteous,
and will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.
Have you understood all these things?” “Yes,” they say to Him.
And He said to them, “Because of this, every scribe having been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a master of a house, who puts forth out of his treasure new and old.”
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, He withdrew from there.
And having come into His own region, He was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they are astonished and are saying, “From where came to this One this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
Is this not the son of the carpenter? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
And are not all His sisters with us? Then from where came to this One all these things?”
And they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in the hometown and in his own household.”
And He did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news of Jesus,
and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and because of this, the miraculous powers are working in him.”
For Herod, having seized John, bound him and put him in prison, on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John had been saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
Although wishing to kill him, he feared the multitude, because they were holding him as a prophet.
But on the birthday of Herod having been celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod,
whereupon he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she should ask.
And having been urged on by her mother she says, “Give me here upon a platter the head of John the Baptist.”
And the king having been grieved, on account of the oaths and those reclining with him, he commanded it to be given.
And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.
And his head was brought on a platter and was given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
And his disciples having come, took the body and buried it, and having come, they told Jesus.
And Jesus having heard, withdrew from there by boat to a secluded place by Himself. And the crowds having heard of it, followed Him on foot from the towns.
And having gone out, He saw a great crowd and was moved with compassion toward them, and He healed their sick.
And evening having come, the disciples came to Him saying, “This place is desolate, and the time already is gone by. Therefore dismiss the crowds, that having gone into the villages, they might buy food for themselves.”
And Jesus said to them, “They have no need to go away. You give to them something to eat.”
And they say to Him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”
And He said, “Bring them here to Me.”
And having commanded the crowds to sit down on the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. And having broken, He gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
And all ate and were satisfied, and they took up that being over and above of the fragments, twelve hand-baskets full.
And those eating were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
And immediately He compelled the disciples to enter into the boat and to go before Him to the other side, until He would have dismissed the crowds.
And having dismissed the crowds, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. And evening having arrived, He was there alone,
and the boat being now many stadia from the land, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night, He went to them, walking on the sea.
And the disciples having seen Him walking on the sea, were troubled saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.
But immediately Jesus spoke to them saying, “Take courage! It is I. Fear not.”
And Peter answering said to Him, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You upon the waters.”
And He said, “Come.” And Peter having descended from the boat, walked upon the water and came to Jesus.
And seeing the charging wind, he was afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out saying, “Lord, save me!”
And immediately Jesus having stretched out the hand, took hold of him and says to him, “O Little faith, why did you waver?”
And they having entered into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are Son of God.”
And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
And the men of that place having recognized Him, sent to all that surrounding region, and brought to Him all those being sick,
and were begging Him that only they might touch the fringe of His garment, and as many as touched were cured.
Then Pharisees and scribes come to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they shall eat bread.”
And answering He said to them, “Why also do you break the commandment of God on account of your tradition?
For God commanded, ‘Honor the Father and mother’ and, ‘The one speaking evil of father or mother, in death must end!’
But you say, ‘Whoever shall say to the father or mother, “Whatever you might be profited by me is a gift,”
he shall not honor his father or his mother.’ And you made void the commandment of God on account of your tradition!
Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly concerning you, saying,
‘This people honors Me with the lips, but their heart is kept far away from Me.
And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’”
And having summoned the crowd, He said to them, “Hear and understand!
It is not what is entering into the mouth that defiles the man; but that going forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”
Then the disciples having approached, said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees, having heard this saying, were offended?”
And answering He said, “Every plant that My Heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.
Leave them! They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
And Peter answering said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”
And He said, “Are you also still without understanding?
Do you not yet understand that everything entering into the mouth goes into the stomach, and is cast out into the sewer?
But the things going forth out of the mouth come forth out of the heart, and these defile the man.
For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immorality, thefts, false testimonies, slanders.
These are the things defiling the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.”
And having gone forth from there, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
And behold, a Canaanite woman from the same region having approached, was crying out saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”
But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples having approached, were imploring Him, saying, “Dismiss her, for she cries out after us!”
And answering He said, “I was sent only to those being lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
And having come, she was worshiping Him saying, “Lord, help me!”
And answering He said, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and to cast it to the dogs.”
And she said, “Yes Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs falling from their masters’ table.”
Then Jesus answering said to her, “O woman, great is your faith. It shall be to you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
And having departed from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on the mountain, He was sitting there.
And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many others. And they placed them at His feet, and He healed them,
so that the crowd marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus, having called His disciples to Him, said, “I am moved with compassion toward the crowd, because they continue with Me three days already and have nothing that they might eat. And I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”
And the disciples say to Him, “From where will be to us in a secluded place so many loaves, as so great a crowd to satisfy?”
And Jesus says to them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
And having commanded the crowds to sit down on the ground,
having taken the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, He broke them and kept giving them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.
And all ate and were satisfied, and they took up that being over and above of the fragments, seven baskets full.
And those eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.
And having dismissed the crowds, He entered into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees having approached testing Him, asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven.
And answering He said to them, “Evening having come, you say, ‘Fair weather, for the sky is red,’
and in the morning, ‘Today a storm, for the sky is red, being overcast.’ Indeed you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but the signs of the times you are not able!
An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” And having left them, He went away.
And the disciples, having come to the other side, forgot to take bread.
And Jesus said to them, “Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, “It is because we did not take bread.”
But having known this, Jesus said, “Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you did not take bread?
Do you not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many hand-baskets you gathered?
Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?
How do you not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?”
Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And Jesus having come into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was questioning His disciples saying, “Whom do men pronounce the Son of Man to be?”
And they said, “Some indeed, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
He says to them, “But whom do you pronounce Me to be?”
And Simon Peter answering said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
And Jesus answering, said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Barjona! For flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in the heavens.
And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades not will prevail against it.
I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you might bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you might loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens.”
Then He instructed the disciples that they should tell no one that He is the Christ.
From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that it is necessary for Him to go away to Jerusalem, and to suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day.
And Peter having taken Him aside, began to rebuke Him, saying, “Far be it from You, Lord! This never will be to You!”
And having turned, He said to Peter, “Get behind Me Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. For your thoughts are not of the things of God, but the things of men.”
Then Jesus said His to disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.
For whoever might desire to save his life will lose it; but whoever might lose his life on account of Me will find it.
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his soul? Or what will a man give as an exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory His Father, with His angels, and then He will give to each according to his deeds.
Truly I say to you, there are some of those standing here who shall not taste of death until they have seen the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”
And after six days, Jesus takes with Him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain by themselves.
And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became white as the light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
And Peter answering said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, I will make here three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
While yet he was speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold, a voice out of the cloud saying, “This is My Son, the beloved, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!”
And the disciples having heard it, fell upon their face and were greatly terrified.
And Jesus having come to them and having touched them, said, “Rise up, and do not be afraid.”
And having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.
And as they were descending from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, saying, “Tell to no one the vision, until the Son of Man is risen out from the dead.”
And the disciples asked Him, saying, “Why then do the scribes say that it behooves Elijah to come first?”
And answering He said, “Elijah indeed comes and will restore all things.
But I say to you that Elijah already is come, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they desired. Thus also, the Son of Man is about to suffer from them.”
Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.
And they having come to the crowd, a man came to Him kneeling down to Him
and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers miserably; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.
And I brought him Your to disciples, and they were not able to heal him.”
And Jesus answering said, “O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.”
And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out from him, and the boy was healed from that hour.
Then the disciples, having come to Jesus in private, said, “Why were we not able to cast it out?”
And He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith as of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. And nothing will be impossible for you.”

And while they were abiding in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,
and they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised up.” And they were deeply grieved.
And they having come to Capernaum, those collecting the didrachmas came to Peter and said, “Does your Teacher pay the didrachmas?”
He says, “Yes.” And he having entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or tribute? From their sons, or from strangers?”
And he having said, “From the strangers,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free.
But that we might not offend them, having gone to the sea, cast a hook and take the first fish having come up, and having opened its mouth, you will find a stater. Having taken that, give it to them for Me and yourself.”
In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”
And having summoned a child, He set it in their midst,
and said, “Truly I say to you, if you are not converted and become as the little children, you shall never enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
Therefore whoever will humble himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
And whoever shall receive one such little child in My name, receives Me.
And whoever shall cause to stumble one of these of the little ones believing in Me, it is better for him that a heavy millstone should be hung around his neck, and he be sunk in the depth of the sea.
Woe to the world because of the causes of sin. For the stumbling blocks are necessary to come, but woe to the man by whom the offense comes!
Now if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life one-eyed, than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.
See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father, who is in the heavens.

What do you think? If to any man there should be a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, will he not leave the ninety nine on the mountains and, having gone, seek the one going astray?
And if he should find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine not having gone astray.
Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should perish.
And if your brother sins against you, go reprove him, between you and him alone. If he will hear you, you have gained your brother.
But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that ‘every word may be strengthened upon the testimony of two or three witnesses.’
And if he fails to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he fails to listen to even to the church, let him be to you as the pagan and the tax collector.
Truly I say to you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.
Again truly I say to you that if two of you on the earth might agree concerning any matter that they shall ask, it will be done for them by My Father who is in the heavens.
For where two or three are gathered together unto My name, there am I in their midst.”
Then Peter having come, said to Him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I will forgive him? Up to seven times?”
Jesus says to him, “I say to you not up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven!
Because of this, the kingdom of the heavens has become like to a man, a king, who desired to settle accounts with his servants.
And he having begun to settle, one was brought to him, a debtor of ten thousand talents.
And of him having nothing to pay, the master commanded him to be sold, and the wife and children, and everything that he had, and payment to be made.
Therefore the servant, having fallen down, was bowing on his knees to him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay everything to you.’
And the master of that servant having been moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt.
But the same servant having gone out, found one of his fellow servants who was owing him a hundred denarii, and having seized him, he was throttling him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’
Therefore his fellow servant having fallen down, was begging him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’
But he was not willing. Rather, having gone, he cast him into prison until he should pay what was owed.
Therefore his fellow servants having seen the things having taken place, were deeply grieved, and having gone, narrated to their master everything having taken place.
Then his master having called him, says to him, ‘Evil servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
Did it not behoove you also to have pitied your fellow servant, as I also had pitied you?’
And having been angry, his master delivered him to the jailers, until that he should pay all being owed to him.
Thus also My Heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from your heart.”
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, He withdrew from Galilee and came to the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
And Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?”
And answering He said, “Have you not read that the One having created from the beginning ‘made them male and female,’
and said, ‘On account of this a man will leave the father and mother and be joined with his wife, and the two will become into one flesh’?—
so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God united together, let man not separate.”
They say to Him, “Why then did Moses command to give a roll of divorce and to send her away?”
He says to them, “In view of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives; but it was not this way from the beginning.
And I say to you that whoever shall divorce his wife except for sexual immorality, and shall marry another, commits adultery.”
His disciples say to Him, “If this is the case of the man with the wife, it is better not to marry.”
And He said to them, “Not all receive this word, but only those to whom it has been given.
For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. The one being able to receive it, let him receive it.”
Then little children were brought to Him, that He might lay the hands on them, and might pray. But the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, “Permit the little children, and do not forbid them to come to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.”
And having laid the hands upon them, He departed from there.
And behold, one having come to Him said, “Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I might have eternal life?”
And He said to him, “Why do you ask Me about what is good? Only One is good. But if you desire to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
He says to Him, “Which?” And Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,
you shall honor the father and mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”
The young man says to him, “All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?”
Jesus was saying to him, “If you desire to be perfect, go, sell what you are possessing, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me.”
And having heard this statement, the young man went away grieving; for he was one having many possessions.
And Jesus said His to disciples, “Truly I say to you that with difficulty a rich man will enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”
And the disciples having heard were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then is able to be saved?”
And Jesus having looked on them, said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Then Peter answering said to Him, “Behold, we left all things and followed You; what then will be to us?”
And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit down upon His throne of glory, you having followed Me, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for the sake of My name, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
For the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, a master of a house, who went out in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
And having agreed with the workmen on a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
and to them he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever might be right.’
And they went. And having gone out again about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.
And about the eleventh having gone out, he found others standing, and says to them, ‘Why do you stand here all the day idle?’
They say to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He says to them, ‘You go also into the vineyard.’
And evening having arrived, the master of the vineyard says to his foreman, ‘Call the workmen and pay them the wages, having begun from the last, up to the first.’
And those hired about the eleventh hour having come, they received a denarius each.
And the first having come, they thought that they will receive more, but they themselves also received a denarius each.
And having received it, they were grumbling against the master of the house,
saying, ‘These the last have worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us, the ones having borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’
And answering one of them, he said, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
Take what is yours and go; and I desire to give to this last, as to you also.
Or is it not lawful for me to do what I will with that which is mine? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?’
Thus the last will be first, and the first, last.”
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside themselves on the way, and said to them,
“Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death.
And they will betray Him to the Gentiles to mock and to flog and to crucify; and the third day He will rise again.”
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, kneeling down and asking something from Him.
And He said to her, “What do you desire?” She says to Him, “Say that these two sons of mine might sit, one on Your right hand and one on Your left hand, in Your kingdom.”
And Jesus answering, said, “You do not know what you ask for. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink?” They say to Him, “We are able.”
He says to them, “Indeed you will drink My cup, but to sit on My right hand and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared by My Father.”
And the ten having heard this, were indignant about the two brothers.
And Jesus having summoned them, said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.
Thus will it not be among you. But whoever wishes to become great among you, he will be your servant;
and whoever wishes to be first among you, he will be your slave—
even as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”
And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.
And behold, two blind men sitting beside the road, having heard that Jesus is passing by, cried out saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
And the crowd rebuked them that they should be silent. But they cried out all the more, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
And Jesus having stopped, called them and said, “What do you desire I should do unto you?”
They say to Him, “Lord, that our eyes might be opened.”
And having been moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they received sight, and they followed Him.
And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey having been tied, and a colt with her. Having untied them, bring them to Me,
and if anyone says anything to you, you will say that the Lord has need of them, and he will send them immediately.”
And this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
“Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your King comes to you, gentle and mounted on a donkey, even upon a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”
And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus commanded them,
brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks upon them, and He sat on them.
And the very great crowd spread their the cloaks on the road, and others were cutting down branches from the trees and were spreading them on the road.
And the crowds going before Him and those following were crying out, saying: “Hosanna to the Son of David!” “Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord!” “Hosanna in the highest!”
And of Him having entered into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, “Who is this?”
And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet, Jesus, the One from Nazareth of Galilee.”
And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling the doves.
And He says to them, “It has been written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer.’ But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”
And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
And the chief priests and the scribes, having seen the wonders that He did and the children crying out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” were indignant
and said to Him, “Do you hear what these say?” And Jesus says to them, “Yes, have you never read: ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings You have prepared for yourself praise’?”
And having left them, He went out of the city to Bethany, and He passed the night there.
And in the morning, having come back into the city, He became hungry.
And having seen one fig tree along the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except only leaves. And He says to it, “Never let there be any more fruit from you, to the age.” And the fig tree withered immediately.
And having seen it, the disciples marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”
And Jesus answering said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and not do doubt, you will do not only this of the fig tree, but even if you should say to this mountain, ‘Be you taken away and be you cast into the sea,’ it will come to pass.
And all things, as many as you might ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”
And of Him having come into the temple, teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him, saying, “By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave to You this authority?”
And Jesus answering, said to them, “I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will say to you by what authority I do these things.
From where was the baptism of John? From heaven, or from men?” And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘from heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
But if we should say, ‘from men,’ we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.”
And answering Jesus, they said “We do not know.” And He said to them, “Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
But what do you think? A man had two sons, and having come to the first he said, ‘Son, go work in the vineyard today.’
And answering he said, ‘I will not.’ But afterward, having repented, he went.
And having come to the second, he said likewise. And answering he said, ‘I will sir,’ and he did not go.
Which of the two did the will of the father?” They say, “The first.” Jesus says to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go before you into the kingdom of God.
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and you having seen, did not even repent afterward to believe him.
Hear another parable: There was a man, a master of a house, who planted a vineyard, and placed around it a fence, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he rented it out to farmers and traveled abroad.
And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruits.
And the farmers having taken his servants, one they beat, and one they killed, and one they stoned.
Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.
And afterward he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
But the farmers having seen the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and gain possession of his inheritance.’
And having taking him, they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Therefore when the master of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those farmers?”
They say to him, “He will destroy them, the wretches, grievously, and he will rent out the vineyard to other farmers who will give to him the fruits in their seasons.”
Jesus says to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone that those building rejected, this has become the chief corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
Because of this I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a people producing its fruits.
And the one having fallen on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.”
And the chief priests and the Pharisees, having heard His parables, knew that He speaks about them.
And seeking to lay hold of Him, they feared the crowds, because they were holding Him as a prophet.
And answering, Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,
“The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man, a king, who made a wedding feast for his son.
And he sent his servants to call those having been invited to the wedding feast—and they were not willing to come.
Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Say to those having been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and the fatlings have been killed, and all things are ready; come to the wedding feast.”’
And having paid no attention they went away, one to the own field, and one to his business.
And the rest, having laid hold of his servants, mistreated and killed them.
And the king was angry, and having sent his armies, he destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Then he says to his servants, ‘Indeed the wedding feast is ready, but those having been invited were not worthy.
Therefore go into the thoroughfares of the highways, and invite to the wedding feast as many as you shall find.’
And those servants, having gone out into the highways, brought together all, as many as they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall became full of those reclining.
And the king having entered in to see those reclining, he beheld a man there not being dressed in wedding clothes.
And he says to him, ‘Friend, how did you enter here not having a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.
Then the king said to the servants, ‘Having bound his hands and feet, cast him out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.’
For many are called, but few chosen.”
Then the Pharisees having gone out, took counsel how they might trap Him in His words.
And they send their disciples to Him, with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and You teach the way of God in the truth, and to You there is care about no one, for You do not look on the appearance of men.
Therefore tell us, what do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?”
But having known their malice, Jesus said, “Hypocrites, why do you test Me?
Show Me the coin of the tribute.” And they presented to Him a denarius.
And He says to them, “Whose likeness and whose inscription is this?”
They say to Him, “Caesar’s.” Then He says to them, “Therefore give back to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God.”
And having heard, they marveled. And having left Him, they went away.
On that day Sadducees, those saying there is no resurrection, came to Him, and they questioned Him,
saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If anyone should die not having children, his brother will marry his wife and will raise up offspring for his brother.’
Now there were seven brothers among us; and the first died, and having married not having seed, he left his wife to his brother.
Likewise also the second, and the third, unto the seventh.
And last of all, the woman died.
In the resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven will she be wife? For all had her.”
And, Jesus answering said to them, “You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection, neither do they marry, nor are given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.
And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which has been spoken to you by God, saying,
‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?’ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
And the crowds having heard, were astonished at His teaching.
And the Pharisees, having heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, were gathered together the same.
And one of them, a lawyer, questioned Him, testing Him,
“Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?”
And He said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’
This is the great and first commandment.
And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”
And the Pharisees having been assembled together, Jesus questioned them,
saying, “What do you think concerning the Christ? Of whom is He son?” They say to Him, “Of David.”
He says to them, “How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying:
‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, until I place Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.”’
If therefore David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?”
And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question Him any longer.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees have sat down on Moses’ seat;
therefore keep and observe all things whatsoever they might tell you. But do not do according to their works, for they preach and do not act.
And they tie up burdens heavy and hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders of men; but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.
And they do all their deeds in order to be seen by men. For they broaden their phylacteries and enlarge their tassels,
and they love the chief place at the banquets, and the first seats in the synagogues,
and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by men.
But you shall not be called ‘Rabbi,’ for your Teacher is One, and you are all brothers.
And call no one your father on the earth; for One is your Father, who is in heaven.
Neither be called instructors; since One is your instructor, the Christ.
But the greatest among you will be your servant.
And whoever shall exalt himself will be humbled, and whoever shall humble himself will be exalted.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men. For you neither enter, nor even do you allow those who are entering to go in.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse the sea and the dry land to make one convert, and whenever it may happen, you make him twofold more a son of Gehenna than yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides, those saying, ‘Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath.’
Foolish and blind! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple having sanctified the gold?
And you say, ‘Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it is bound by his oath.’
Blind! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar sanctifying the gift?
Therefore the one having sworn by the altar swears by it and by all things that are upon it.
And the one having sworn by the temple swears by it and by the One dwelling in it.
And the one having sworn by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the One sitting upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and you have neglected the weightier things of the Law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. It behooved you to do these, and not to be leaving aside those.
Blind guides—those straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of greed and intemperance.
