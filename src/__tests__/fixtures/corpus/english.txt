BLB - Berean Literal Bible
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begat Perez and Zerah out of Tamar, and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram.
And Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon.
And Salmon begat Boaz out of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed out of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,
and Jesse begat David the king. Next: David begat Solomon, out of the wife of Uriah,
and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah.
And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amos, and Amos begat Josiah,
and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.
And after the carrying away to Babylon: Jechoniah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,
and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor.
And Azor begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud.
And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, the One being called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ came about in this way: His mother Mary, having been pledged to Joseph, before their coming together, was found holding in womb through the Holy Spirit.
Then Joseph her husband, being righteous and not willing to shame her publicly, resolved to divorce her quietly.
But on his having pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, you should not be afraid to receive Mary as your wife, for that having been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
And she will bring forth a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”
And all this has come to pass, so that it may be fulfilled that having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
“Behold, the virgin will hold in womb, and will bring forth a son, and they will call His name Immanuel” which is, being translated, “God with us.”
And Joseph, having been awoken from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and received his wife.
But he did not know her until she had brought forth a Son, and he called His name Jesus.
Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
saying, “Where is the One having been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.”
And King Herod having heard this, was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
And having assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring of them where the Christ was to be born.
And they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus has it been written through the prophet:
‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come forth One leading, who will shepherd My people Israel.’”
Then Herod, having called the Magi secretly, inquired of them the exact time of the star appearing.
And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, “Having gone, search carefully for the Child; and when You shall have found Him, bring word back to me, so that I also having come, may worship Him.”
And having heard the king, they departed. And behold, the star they had seen in the east went before them until, having arrived, it stood over the place where the Child was.
And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
And having come into the house, they found the Child with His mother Mary, and having fallen down, they worshiped Him. And having opened their treasures, they offered to Him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
And having been divinely warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew into their own country by another route.
And of them having withdrawn, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream saying, “Having arisen, take the Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I should tell you, for Herod is about to seek the Child to destroy Him.”
And having arisen, he took the Child and His mother by night and withdrew into Egypt,
and there he remained until the death of Herod, so that it might be fulfilled what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I have called my Son.”
Then Herod, having seen that he had been outwitted by the Magi, was intensely enraged. And having sent forth, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its vicinity from two years old and under, according to the time he had ascertained from the Magi.
Then was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, saying:
“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she would not be comforted, because they are not.”
But of Herod having died, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
saying, “Having arisen, take the Child and His mother and go into the land of Israel; for those seeking the life of the Child have died.”
And having arisen, he took the Child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.
And having heard that Archelaus reigns over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew into the district of Galilee.
And having come, he dwelt in a city being called Nazareth, so that it should be fulfilled that having been spoken through the prophets, that “He will be called a Nazarene.”
Now in those days John the Baptist comes, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”
For this is the one having been spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.’”
And John himself had his garment of camel’s hair, and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
At that time were going out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan,
and confessing their sins, were being baptized by him in the Jordan River.
But having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance.
And do not presume to say within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that out of these stones God is able to raise up children unto Abraham.
Already now the ax is applied to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but after me is coming He who is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to carry the sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,
whose winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will clear His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.
But John was hindering Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?”
But Jesus answering, said unto him, “Permit it presently; for thus it is fitting to us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permits Him.
And immediately, having been baptized, Jesus went up from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and alighting upon Him.
And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, “This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I was well pleased.”
Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.
And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.
And the one tempting, having come to Him, said “If You are Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread.”
But answering He said, “It has been written: ‘The man shall live not by bread alone, but by every word coming out of the mouth of God.’”
Then the devil takes Him to the holy city and sets Him upon the pinnacle of the temple,
and says to him, “If You are Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it has been written: ‘He will give orders to His angels concerning You, and will they bear You up in their hands, lest ever You strike Your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus said to him, “Again it has been written: ‘You shall not test the Lord your God.’”
Again the devil takes Him to a mountain exceedingly high and shows to Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he says to Him, “All these things I will give to You, if falling down, You will worship me.”
Then Jesus says to him, “Get you away, Satan! For it has been written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone shall you serve.’”
Then the devil leaves Him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to Him.
And having heard that John had been arrested, He withdrew into Galilee.
And having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum, on the sea-side in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying:
“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and to those sitting in the land and shadow of death, a light has dawned on them.”
From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!”
Now walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And He says to them, “Come follow after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
And immediately having left the nets, they followed Him.
And having gone on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And He called them,
and immediately having left the boat and their father they followed Him.
And He was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
And the news of Him went out into all Syria. And they brought to Him all the sick having various diseases and oppressing pains, and being possessed by demons, and having seizures, and paralytics—and He healed them.
And there followed Him great crowds from Galilee, and the Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
And having seen the crowds, He went up on the mountain. And He having sat down, His disciples came to Him,
and opening His mouth, He was teaching them, saying:
“Blessed are the poor in the spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
Blessed are those mourning, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.
Blessed are those having been persecuted on account of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
Blessed are you when they shall insult you and shall persecute you, and lying shall say all kinds of evil against you on account of Me.
Rejoice and exult, because great is your reward in the heavens; for thus they persecuted the prophets before you.
You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what will it be salted. For nothing is it potent any longer except, having been cast out, to be trampled upon by men.
You are the light of the world. A city lying on a hill is unable to be hidden.
Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but upon the lampstand, and it gives light to all those in the house.
Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and they should glorify your Father in the heavens.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth shall pass away, not even one iota, nor one stroke of a letter, shall pass away from the law, until everything should happen.
Whoever then shall break one of the least of these commandments and shall teach others the same, he will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever shall keep and shall teach them, he will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
For I say to you that unless your righteousness shall abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You shall not murder’ and ‘Whoever shall murder will be liable to the judgment.’
But I say to you that everyone being angry with his brother will be liable to the judgment, and whoever shall say to his brother ‘Raca,’ will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever shall say, ‘Fool!’ will be liable to the Gehenna of fire.
Therefore, if you shall offer your gift at the altar, and there shall remember that your brother has something against you,
leave your gift there before the altar and first go away, be reconciled to your brother; and then having come, offer your gift.
Be agreeing quickly with your accuser while you are on the way with him, lest ever the accuser deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you will be cast into prison.
Truly I say to you, you shall not come out from there until you should pay the last kodranten!
You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’
But I say to you that everyone looking upon a woman in order to lust after her already has committed adultery with her in his heart.
And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. For it is better for you that one of your members should perish and not that your whole body should be cast into Gehenna.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you, for it is better for you that one of your members should perish and not that your whole body should depart into Gehenna.
It was also said, ‘Whoever shall divorce his wife, let him give her a letter of divorce.’
But I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever shall marry her who has been divorced commits adultery.
Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but you shall keep your oaths to the Lord.’
But I say to you not to swear at all: neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God;
nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
Neither shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.
But let your statement ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and ‘No,’ ‘No.’ Anything more than these comes from evil.
You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’
But I tell you not to resist the evil person. Instead, whoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And to the one willing to sue you and to take your tunic, yield to him the cloak as well.
And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go with him two.
Give to the one asking of you, and you shall not turn away from the one desiring to borrow from you.
You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those persecuting you,
so that you may be sons of your Father in the heavens. For He makes His sun rise on evil and good, and He sends rain on righteous and unrighteous.
For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
And if you greet only your brothers, what extraordinary are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
You shall be perfect, therefore, as your Heavenly Father is perfect.
And beware not to do your righteousness before men in order to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward in the presence of your Father in the heavens.
Therefore when you perform acts of charity, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Truly I say to you, they have their recompense.
But you, doing acts of charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, the One seeing in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets so that they might be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their recompense.
But you when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father, the One in secret. And your Father, the One seeing in secret, will reward you.
And praying, do not use vain repetitions like the pagans, for they think that in their many words they will be heard.
Therefore do not be like to them, for your Father knows of what things you have need before your asking Him.
Therefore pray you like this: ‘Our Father in the heavens, hallowed be Your name!
Your kingdom come. Your will be done as in heaven, so also upon earth.
Our daily bread, grant us today.
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
And whenever you fast, do not be downcast in countenance like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they might appear to men as fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their recompense.
But you fasting, anoint your head and wash your face,
so that you might not appear to men as fasting, but to your Father, the One in secret. And your Father, the One seeing in secret, will reward you.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroy, and where thieves do not break in nor steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and he will love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and he will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and mammon.
Because of this I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor your body, what you should put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow nor do they reap, nor do they gather into barns, and your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
And who of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his stature?
And why do you worry about clothing? Consider carefully how the lilies of the field grow: They do not labor nor do they spin.
Yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these.
But if God thus clothes the grass of the field, existing today and tomorrow being thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ Or ‘What shall we drink?’ Or ‘What shall we wear?’
For the Gentiles seek after all these things. For your Heavenly Father knows that you have need of them all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Sufficient to the day is its own trouble.
Do not judge, lest you should be judged.
For with that verdict you pronounce, you will be judged; and with that measure you measure, it will be measured to you.
And why do you look at the splinter in your brother’s eye, but not notice the beam in your own eye?
Or how shall you say to your brother, ‘Permit that I might cast out the splinter from your eye,’ and behold, the beam is in your eye?
Hypocrite! First cast out the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the splinter from the eye of your brother.
Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the pigs, lest they shall trample upon them with their feet, and having turned, tear you to pieces.
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened unto you.
For everyone asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking, it will be opened.
Or which man is among you who, if his son will ask for bread, will give him a stone?
Or also, if he will ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?
Therefore, if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in the heavens give good things to those asking Him!
All things therefore, as many as you might desire that men should do to you, so also you do to them, for this is the law and the prophets.
Enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad the way leading to destruction, and many are those entering through it.
For small is the gate and narrow the way leading to life, and few are those finding it.
Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
By their fruits you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
So every good tree bears good fruits, but the rotten tree bears bad fruits.
A good tree is not able to bear bad fruits, nor a bad tree to bear good fruits.
Every tree not bearing good fruit is cut down and is thrown into fire.
Then surely by their fruits you will recognize them.
Not everyone saying to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of My Father in the heavens.
Many will say to Me in that the day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’
And then I will declare unto them, ‘I never knew you; depart you from Me, those working lawlessness.’
Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock.
And the rain came down, and the torrents came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it did not fall, for its foundation had been lain upon the rock.
And everyone hearing these words of Mine and not acting on them, he will be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.
And the rain came down, and the torrents came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell—and great was its collapse!”
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at His teaching.
for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
And He having come down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
And behold a leper having come, was worshipping Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You are able to cleanse me.”
And having stretched out the hand, He touched him saying, “I am willing; be you cleansed!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
And Jesus says to him, “See that you tell no one. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”
And He having entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him,
and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”
And He says to him, “I having come, will heal him.”
But the centurion answering, said, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
And Jesus having heard, marveled and said to those following, “Truly I say to you, no one in Israel with faith so great have I found.
And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.
But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.”
And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you have believed, be it to you.” And his servant was healed in that very hour.
And Jesus having come to the house of Peter, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick and fevering.
And He touched her hand and the fever left her; and she arose and was ministering unto them.
And evening having come, they brought to Him many being possessed with demons, and He cast out the spirits with a word and He healed all those being sick,
so that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying, “He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”
And Jesus, having seen a great crowd around Him, gave orders to depart to the other side.
And one scribe, having approached Him, said “Teacher, I will follow You wherever that You should go.”
And Jesus says to him, “Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere He might lay the head.”
And another of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, allow me first to go and to bury my father.”
But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”
And He having entered into the boat, His disciples followed Him.
And behold, a great storm arose in the sea so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but He Himself was sleeping.
And having approached, they awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us, we are perishing!”
And He says to them, “O you of little faith, Why are you afraid?” Then having arisen, He rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”
And He having come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two being possessed by demons met Him, coming forth out of the tombs, extremely violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.
And behold, they cried out saying, “What to us and to you Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”
Now there was far off from them a herd of many pigs feeding.
And the demons were begging Him, saying, “If You cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs.”
And He said to them, “Go!” And having gone out, they went away into the pigs, and behold, all the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.
And those feeding them fled, and having gone away into the city, they related everything, including the matter of those being possessed by demons.
And behold, all the city went out to meet Jesus. And having seen Him, they begged Him that He would depart from their region.
And having entered into a boat, He passed over and came to the own city.
And behold, they were bringing to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. And Jesus, having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son; your sins have been forgiven.”
And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This one blasphemes!”
And Jesus, having known their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?
For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” Then He says to the paralytic, “Having arisen, take up your mat and go to your house.”
And having arisen, he went away to his house.
And the crowds having seen, marveled and glorified God, the One having given such authority to men.
And Jesus passing on from there saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth. And He says to him, “Follow Me.” And having arisen, he followed Him.
And it came to pass, of Him reclining in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners having come, were reclining with Jesus and His disciples.
And having seen it, the Pharisees said to His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?”
And having heard, He said, “Not those being strong have need of a physician, but those being sick.
But having gone, learn what is, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”
Then the disciples of John come to Him saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”
And Jesus said to them, “Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then they will fast.
But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on old clothing, for the filling up of it tears away from the garment, and a worse tear emerges.
Nor do they pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wineskins are burst, and the wine is poured out, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”
Of Him speaking these things to them, behold, a certain ruler having come, was kneeling down to Him, saying, “My daughter presently has died; but having come, lay Your hand upon her, and she will live.”
And having arisen, Jesus followed him, also His disciples.
And behold a woman having had a flux of blood twelve years, having come up behind Him, touched the fringe of His garment.
For she was saying within herself, “If only I shall touch His garment, I will be healed.”
And Jesus, having turned and having seen her said, “Take courage, daughter. Your faith has cured you.” And the woman was cured from that very hour.
And Jesus having come into the ruler’s house and having seen the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
He says, “Go away, for the girl is not dead, but sleeps.” And they began to laugh at Him.
And when the crowd had been put outside, having entered, He took hold of her hand, and the girl arose.
And this report went out into all that land.
And Jesus passing on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David.”
And having come into the house, the blind men came to Him, and Jesus says to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They say to him, “Yes, Lord.”
Then He touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith be it to you.”
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly instructed them, saying, “See that no one knows!”
But having gone out, they made Him known in all that land.
And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a mute man, possessed by a demon.
And the demon having been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, “Never thus was it seen in Israel.”
But the Pharisees were saying, “By the prince of the demons He casts out demons.”
And Jesus was going throughout all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.
And having seen the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were wearied and cast away, as sheep not having a shepherd.
Then He says to His disciples, “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the workmen are few.
Beseech the Lord of the harvest, therefore, that He might send out workmen into His harvest.”
And having summoned His twelve disciples, He gave to them authority over unclean spirits, so as to cast them out and to heal every disease and every sickness.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon called Peter, and his brother Andrew; and James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus;
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one also having betrayed Him.
These twelve, Jesus sent forth, having instructed them, saying: “Do not go into the way of the Gentiles and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.
But go rather to those being the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And going on, proclaim, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!’
Heal the ailing, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons! Freely you received; freely give.
Take along neither gold nor silver nor copper in your belts,
nor provision-bag for the way, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the workman is worthy of his provisions.
And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it. Remain there until you go forth.
And entering into the house, greet it.
And if indeed the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
And whoever will not receive you nor will hear your words, shake off the dust of your feet going forth out of that house or that city!
Truly I say to you, on the day of judgment, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and of Gomorrah than for that city.
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves.
But beware of men; for they will deliver you into the courts and they will flog you in their synagogues.
And you will be brought also before governors and kings on account of Me, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
And when they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what you should speak; for in that hour you will be given what you should say,
for you are not those speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father, child; and children will rise up against parents and will put them to death.
And you will be hated by all on account of My name; but the one having endured to the end, he will be saved.
And whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next. For truly I say to you, you shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.
It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the master of the house they called Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!
Therefore you should not fear them! For nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops!
And you should not be afraid of those killing the body but not being able to kill the soul. Indeed rather you should fear the One being able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
And even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Therefore you should not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.
Therefore everyone who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father in the heavens.
And whoever shall deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father in the heavens.
Do not think that I came to bring peace to the earth; I came not to bring peace, but a sword.
For I came to set at variance ‘A man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,
and the enemies of the man are his own household.’
The one loving father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me, and the one loving son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me.
And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
The one having found his life will lose it, and the one having lost his life on account of Me will find it.
The One receiving you receives Me, and the one receiving Me receives the One having sent Me.
The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet, and the one receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive the reward of a righteous man.
And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall certainly not lose his reward.”
And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.
And John, having heard in prison the works of the Christ, having sent two of his disciples,
said to Him, “Are You the coming One, or are we to look for another?”
And Jesus answering, said to them, “Having gone, relate to John what you hear and see:
The blind receive sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor are gospelized.
And blessed is he who shall not fall away in Me.”
And as these were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what did you go out to see? A man having been dressed in delicate clothing? Behold, those wearing delicate clothing are in kings’ houses.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one more excellent than a prophet.
For this is he about whom it has been written: ‘Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.’
Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he!
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence and the violent seize it.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, the one being about to come.
The one having ears, let him hear!
But to what will I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the markets and calling out to others,
saying: ‘We piped for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge and you did not wail.’
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her deeds.”
Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had taken place, because they did not repent.
“Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! For if the miracles having taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, then they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I say to you, in the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, but will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles having taken place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you that in day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you.”
At that time, Jesus answering said, “I fully consent to You, Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, that You did hide these things from the wise and learned, and did reveal them to little children.
Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing before You.
All things have been delivered to Me by My Father. And no one knows the Son, except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and to whom the Son might choose to reveal Him.
Come to Me, all those toiling and being burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbaths, and His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck the heads of grain and to eat them.
And the Pharisees, having seen, said to Him, “Behold, Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on Sabbath.”
And He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those with him—
how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the loaves of the presentation, which it was not lawful for him nor for those with him to eat, but only for the priests?
Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?
But I say to you that a greater than the temple is here.
But if you had known what this is, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ then you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
And having departed from there, He went into their synagogue.
And behold, a man having a withered hand, and they asked Him saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbaths?”—so that they might accuse Him.
And He said to them, “What man will there be among you, who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbaths, will not take hold of it and will raise it up?
How much more valuable therefore is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbaths.”
Then He says to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored, as sound as the other.
And the Pharisees having gone out, held a counsel against Him, how they might destroy Him.
And Jesus having known, withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all,
and He warned them that they should not make Him known—
so that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying:
“Behold My servant, whom I have chosen, My beloved, in whom My soul has found delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
He will not quarrel nor will he cry out; nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not quench, until He leads justice to victory.
And in His name the Gentiles will hope.”
Then was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, and He healed him, in order for the mute man to speak and to see.
And all the crowds were amazed, and were saying, “Could this be the son of David?”
And the Pharisees having heard, said, “This man casts out the demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”
And having known their thoughts, He said to them, “Every kingdom having been divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house having been divided against itself will not stand.
And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? On account of this, they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong man, and to plunder his goods, unless first he binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.
The one not being with Me is against Me, and the one not gathering with Me scatters.
Because of this I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men; but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
And if anyone speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but if anyone speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the coming one.
Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad. For the tree is known by the fruit.
Offspring of vipers, how are you able to speak good things, being evil? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
The good man out of his good treasure puts forth good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure puts forth evil things.
And I say to you that every careless word that they will speak, men will give an account of it in day of judgment.
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.”
And answering He said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this the generation and will condemn it. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Now when the unclean spirit is gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it.
Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from where I came out.’ And having come, it finds it being unoccupied, and swept, and put in order.
Then it goes and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself; and having entered in, they dwell there, and the last of that the man becomes worse than the first. So also will it be unto this evil generation.”
Now while He was speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him.
Then someone said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to You.”
And answering, He said to the one telling Him, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?”
And having stretched out His hand to His disciples, He said, “Behold, My mother and My brothers.
For whoever shall do the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother.”
In that same day, Jesus, having gone forth from the house, was sitting by the sea.
And great crowds were gathered together to Him, so that He having entered into a boat, sat down, and all the crowd stood on the shore.
And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, “Behold, the one sowing went out to sow.
And in his sowing, indeed some fell along the road, and the birds having come, devoured them.
And other fell upon the rocky places where it did not have much soil. And it sprang up immediately, through having no depth of soil.
And the sun having risen, they were scorched, and through not having root, were dried up.
And other fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
And other fell upon the good soil and were yielding fruit—indeed some a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.
The one having ears, let him hear!”
And the disciples having approached, said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”
And answering He said to them, “Because it has been granted to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been granted.
For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will be in abundance. And whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
Because of this I speak to them in parables: ‘Because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.’
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, saying: ‘In hearing you will hear and never understand; and in seeing you will see and never perceive.
For the heart of this people has grown dull, and they barely hear with the ears, and they have closed their eyes, lest ever they should see with the eyes, and they should hear with the ears, and they should understand with the heart, and should turn, and I will heal them.’
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.
You, therefore, hear the parable of the one having sown:
Everyone hearing the word of the kingdom and not understanding, the evil one comes and snatches away that having been sown in his heart. This is the one having been sown on the path.
And the one having been sown upon the rocky places, this is the one hearing the word and immediately receiving it with joy.
And he has in himself no root, but is temporary. And having come tribulation or persecution on account of the word, immediately he falls away.
And the one having been sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the care of this present age and the deceit of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
But the one having been sown on the good soil, this is the one hearing the word and understanding, who indeed brings forth fruit and produces—indeed, some a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.”
He put before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man having sown good seed in his field.
And while the men are sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds in the midst of the wheat, and went away.
And when the plants sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.
And the servants, having approached the master of the house, said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’
And he said to them, ‘An enemy did this.’ And the servants said to him, ‘Then do you desire that having gone forth, we should gather them?’
And he said, ‘No, lest gathering the weeds, you would uproot the wheat with them.
Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the harvesters, “First gather the weeds, and bind them into bundles in order to burn them; then gather together the wheat into my barn.”’”
He put before them another parable, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man having taken, sowed in his field,
which indeed is smallest of all the seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the garden plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and encamp in its branches.”
He spoke to them another parable: “The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables, and He was not speaking to them without a parable,
so that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet, saying: “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”
Then having dismissed the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.”
And answering He said, “The One sowing the good seed is the Son of Man;
and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil one;
and the enemy having sown them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the harvesters are angels.
Therefore, as the weeds are gathered and consumed in fire, so will it be in the consummation of the age.
The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and those practicing lawlessness,
and they will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one having ears, let him hear!
The kingdom of the heavens is like treasure having been hidden in the field, which a man having found, hid. And for joy over it, he goes and he sells all that he has, and buys that field.
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
And having found one very precious pearl, having gone away, he has sold all things as many as he had, and bought it.
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet having been cast into the sea, and having gathered together of every kind,
which when it was filled, they having drawn it up on the shore and having sat down, collected the good into vessels, and they cast out the bad.
Thus will it be in the consummation of the age: The angels will go out and will separate the evil from the midst of the righteous,
and will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.
Have you understood all these things?” “Yes,” they say to Him.
And He said to them, “Because of this, every scribe having been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a master of a house, who puts forth out of his treasure new and old.”
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, He withdrew from there.
And having come into His own region, He was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they are astonished and are saying, “From where came to this One this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
Is this not the son of the carpenter? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
And are not all His sisters with us? Then from where came to this One all these things?”
And they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in the hometown and in his own household.”
And He did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news of Jesus,
and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and because of this, the miraculous powers are working in him.”
For Herod, having seized John, bound him and put him in prison, on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John had been saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
Although wishing to kill him, he feared the multitude, because they were holding him as a prophet.
But on the birthday of Herod having been celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod,
whereupon he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she should ask.
And having been urged on by her mother she says, “Give me here upon a platter the head of John the Baptist.”
And the king having been grieved, on account of the oaths and those reclining with him, he commanded it to be given.
And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.
And his head was brought on a platter and was given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
And his disciples having come, took the body and buried it, and having come, they told Jesus.
And Jesus having heard, withdrew from there by boat to a secluded place by Himself. And the crowds having heard of it, followed Him on foot from the towns.
And having gone out, He saw a great crowd and was moved with compassion toward them, and He healed their sick.
And evening having come, the disciples came to Him saying, “This place is desolate, and the time already is gone by. Therefore dismiss the crowds, that having gone into the villages, they might buy food for themselves.”
And Jesus said to them, “They have no need to go away. You give to them something to eat.”
And they say to Him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”
And He said, “Bring them here to Me.”
And having commanded the crowds to sit down on the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. And having broken, He gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
And all ate and were satisfied, and they took up that being over and above of the fragments, twelve hand-baskets full.
And those eating were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
And immediately He compelled the disciples to enter into the boat and to go before Him to the other side, until He would have dismissed the crowds.
And having dismissed the crowds, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. And evening having arrived, He was there alone,
and the boat being now many stadia from the land, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night, He went to them, walking on the sea.
And the disciples having seen Him walking on the sea, were troubled saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.
But immediately Jesus spoke to them saying, “Take courage! It is I. Fear not.”
And Peter answering said to Him, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You upon the waters.”
And He said, “Come.” And Peter having descended from the boat, walked upon the water and came to Jesus.
And seeing the charging wind, he was afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out saying, “Lord, save me!”
And immediately Jesus having stretched out the hand, took hold of him and says to him, “O Little faith, why did you waver?”
And they having entered into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are Son of God.”
And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
And the men of that place having recognized Him, sent to all that surrounding region, and brought to Him all those being sick,
and were begging Him that only they might touch the fringe of His garment, and as many as touched were cured.
Then Pharisees and scribes come to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they shall eat bread.”
And answering He said to them, “Why also do you break the commandment of God on account of your tradition?
For God commanded, ‘Honor the Father and mother’ and, ‘The one speaking evil of father or mother, in death must end!’
But you say, ‘Whoever shall say to the father or mother, “Whatever you might be profited by me is a gift,”
he shall not honor his father or his mother.’ And you made void the commandment of God on account of your tradition!
Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly concerning you, saying,
‘This people honors Me with the lips, but their heart is kept far away from Me.
And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’”
And having summoned the crowd, He said to them, “Hear and understand!
It is not what is entering into the mouth that defiles the man; but that going forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”
Then the disciples having approached, said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees, having heard this saying, were offended?”
And answering He said, “Every plant that My Heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.
Leave them! They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
And Peter answering said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”
And He said, “Are you also still without understanding?
Do you not yet understand that everything entering into the mouth goes into the stomach, and is cast out into the sewer?
But the things going forth out of the mouth come forth out of the heart, and these defile the man.
For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immorality, thefts, false testimonies, slanders.
These are the things defiling the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.”
And having gone forth from there, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
And behold, a Canaanite woman from the same region having approached, was crying out saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”
But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples having approached, were imploring Him, saying, “Dismiss her, for she cries out after us!”
And answering He said, “I was sent only to those being lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
And having come, she was worshiping Him saying, “Lord, help me!”
And answering He said, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and to cast it to the dogs.”
And she said, “Yes Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs falling from their masters’ table.”
Then Jesus answering said to her, “O woman, great is your faith. It shall be to you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
And having departed from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on the mountain, He was sitting there.
And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many others. And they placed them at His feet, and He healed them,
so that the crowd marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus, having called His disciples to Him, said, “I am moved with compassion toward the crowd, because they continue with Me three days already and have nothing that they might eat. And I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”
And the disciples say to Him, “From where will be to us in a secluded place so many loaves, as so great a crowd to satisfy?”
And Jesus says to them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
And having commanded the crowds to sit down on the ground,
having taken the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, He broke them and kept giving them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.
And all ate and were satisfied, and they took up that being over and above of the fragments, seven baskets full.
And those eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.
And having dismissed the crowds, He entered into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees having approached testing Him, asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven.
And answering He said to them, “Evening having come, you say, ‘Fair weather, for the sky is red,’
and in the morning, ‘Today a storm, for the sky is red, being overcast.’ Indeed you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but the signs of the times you are not able!
An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” And having left them, He went away.
And the disciples, having come to the other side, forgot to take bread.
And Jesus said to them, “Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, “It is because we did not take bread.”
But having known this, Jesus said, “Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you did not take bread?
Do you not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many hand-baskets you gathered?
Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?
How do you not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?”
Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And Jesus having come into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was questioning His disciples saying, “Whom do men pronounce the Son of Man to be?”
And they said, “Some indeed, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
He says to them, “But whom do you pronounce Me to be?”
And Simon Peter answering said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
And Jesus answering, said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Barjona! For flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in the heavens.
And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades not will prevail against it.
I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you might bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you might loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens.”
Then He instructed the disciples that they should tell no one that He is the Christ.
From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that it is necessary for Him to go away to Jerusalem, and to suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day.
And Peter having taken Him aside, began to rebuke Him, saying, “Far be it from You, Lord! This never will be to You!”
And having turned, He said to Peter, “Get behind Me Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. For your thoughts are not of the things of God, but the things of men.”
Then Jesus said His to disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.
For whoever might desire to save his life will lose it; but whoever might lose his life on account of Me will find it.
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his soul? Or what will a man give as an exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory His Father, with His angels, and then He will give to each according to his deeds.
Truly I say to you, there are some of those standing here who shall not taste of death until they have seen the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”
And after six days, Jesus takes with Him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain by themselves.
And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became white as the light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
And Peter answering said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, I will make here three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
While yet he was speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold, a voice out of the cloud saying, “This is My Son, the beloved, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!”
And the disciples having heard it, fell upon their face and were greatly terrified.
And Jesus having come to them and having touched them, said, “Rise up, and do not be afraid.”
And having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.
And as they were descending from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, saying, “Tell to no one the vision, until the Son of Man is risen out from the dead.”
And the disciples asked Him, saying, “Why then do the scribes say that it behooves Elijah to come first?”
And answering He said, “Elijah indeed comes and will restore all things.
But I say to you that Elijah already is come, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they desired. Thus also, the Son of Man is about to suffer from them.”
Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.
And they having come to the crowd, a man came to Him kneeling down to Him
and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers miserably; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.
And I brought him Your to disciples, and they were not able to heal him.”
And Jesus answering said, “O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.”
And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out from him, and the boy was healed from that hour.
Then the disciples, having come to Jesus in private, said, “Why were we not able to cast it out?”
And He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith as of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. And nothing will be impossible for you.”

And while they were abiding in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,
and they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised up.” And they were deeply grieved.
And they having come to Capernaum, those collecting the didrachmas came to Peter and said, “Does your Teacher pay the didrachmas?”
He says, “Yes.” And he having entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or tribute? From their sons, or from strangers?”
And he having said, “From the strangers,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free.
But that we might not offend them, having gone to the sea, cast a hook and take the first fish having come up, and having opened its mouth, you will find a stater. Having taken that, give it to them for Me and yourself.”
In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”
And having summoned a child, He set it in their midst,
and said, “Truly I say to you, if you are not converted and become as the little children, you shall never enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
Therefore whoever will humble himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
And whoever shall receive one such little child in My name, receives Me.
And whoever shall cause to stumble one of these of the little ones believing in Me, it is better for him that a heavy millstone should be hung around his neck, and he be sunk in the depth of the sea.
Woe to the world because of the causes of sin. For the stumbling blocks are necessary to come, but woe to the man by whom the offense comes!
Now if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life one-eyed, than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.
See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father, who is in the heavens.

What do you think? If to any man there should be a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, will he not leave the ninety nine on the mountains and, having gone, seek the one going astray?
And if he should find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine not having gone astray.
Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should perish.
And if your brother sins against you, go reprove him, between you and him alone. If he will hear you, you have gained your brother.
But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that ‘every word may be strengthened upon the testimony of two or three witnesses.’
And if he fails to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he fails to listen to even to the church, let him be to you as the pagan and the tax collector.
Truly I say to you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.
Again truly I say to you that if two of you on the earth might agree concerning any matter that they shall ask, it will be done for them by My Father who is in the heavens.
For where two or three are gathered together unto My name, there am I in their midst.”
Then Peter having come, said to Him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I will forgive him? Up to seven times?”
Jesus says to him, “I say to you not up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven!
Because of this, the kingdom of the heavens has become like to a man, a king, who desired to settle accounts with his servants.
And he having begun to settle, one was brought to him, a debtor of ten thousand talents.
And of him having nothing to pay, the master commanded him to be sold, and the wife and children, and everything that he had, and payment to be made.
Therefore the servant, having fallen down, was bowing on his knees to him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay everything to you.’
And the master of that servant having been moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt.
But the same servant having gone out, found one of his fellow servants who was owing him a hundred denarii, and having seized him, he was throttling him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’
Therefore his fellow servant having fallen down, was begging him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’
But he was not willing. Rather, having gone, he cast him into prison until he should pay what was owed.
Therefore his fellow servants having seen the things having taken place, were deeply grieved, and having gone, narrated to their master everything having taken place.
Then his master having called him, says to him, ‘Evil servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
Did it not behoove you also to have pitied your fellow servant, as I also had pitied you?’
And having been angry, his master delivered him to the jailers, until that he should pay all being owed to him.
Thus also My Heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from your heart.”
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, He withdrew from Galilee and came to the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
And Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?”
And answering He said, “Have you not read that the One having created from the beginning ‘made them male and female,’
and said, ‘On account of this a man will leave the father and mother and be joined with his wife, and the two will become into one flesh’?—
so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God united together, let man not separate.”
They say to Him, “Why then did Moses command to give a roll of divorce and to send her away?”
He says to them, “In view of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives; but it was not this way from the beginning.
And I say to you that whoever shall divorce his wife except for sexual immorality, and shall marry another, commits adultery.”
His disciples say to Him, “If this is the case of the man with the wife, it is better not to marry.”
And He said to them, “Not all receive this word, but only those to whom it has been given.
For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. The one being able to receive it, let him receive it.”
Then little children were brought to Him, that He might lay the hands on them, and might pray. But the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, “Permit the little children, and do not forbid them to come to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.”
And having laid the hands upon them, He departed from there.
And behold, one having come to Him said, “Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I might have eternal life?”
And He said to him, “Why do you ask Me about what is good? Only One is good. But if you desire to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
He says to Him, “Which?” And Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,
you shall honor the father and mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”
The young man says to him, “All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?”
Jesus was saying to him, “If you desire to be perfect, go, sell what you are possessing, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me.”
And having heard this statement, the young man went away grieving; for he was one having many possessions.
And Jesus said His to disciples, “Truly I say to you that with difficulty a rich man will enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”
And the disciples having heard were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then is able to be saved?”
And Jesus having looked on them, said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Then Peter answering said to Him, “Behold, we left all things and followed You; what then will be to us?”
And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit down upon His throne of glory, you having followed Me, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for the sake of My name, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
For the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, a master of a house, who went out in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
And having agreed with the workmen on a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
and to them he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever might be right.’
And they went. And having gone out again about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.
And about the eleventh having gone out, he found others standing, and says to them, ‘Why do you stand here all the day idle?’
They say to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He says to them, ‘You go also into the vineyard.’
And evening having arrived, the master of the vineyard says to his foreman, ‘Call the workmen and pay them the wages, having begun from the last, up to the first.’
And those hired about the eleventh hour having come, they received a denarius each.
And the first having come, they thought that they will receive more, but they themselves also received a denarius each.
And having received it, they were grumbling against the master of the house,
saying, ‘These the last have worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us, the ones having borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’
And answering one of them, he said, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
Take what is yours and go; and I desire to give to this last, as to you also.
Or is it not lawful for me to do what I will with that which is mine? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?’
Thus the last will be first, and the first, last.”
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside themselves on the way, and said to them,
“Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death.
And they will betray Him to the Gentiles to mock and to flog and to crucify; and the third day He will rise again.”
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, kneeling down and asking something from Him.
And He said to her, “What do you desire?” She says to Him, “Say that these two sons of mine might sit, one on Your right hand and one on Your left hand, in Your kingdom.”
And Jesus answering, said, “You do not know what you ask for. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink?” They say to Him, “We are able.”
He says to them, “Indeed you will drink My cup, but to sit on My right hand and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared by My Father.”
And the ten having heard this, were indignant about the two brothers.
And Jesus having summoned them, said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.
Thus will it not be among you. But whoever wishes to become great among you, he will be your servant;
and whoever wishes to be first among you, he will be your slave—
even as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”
And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.
And behold, two blind men sitting beside the road, having heard that Jesus is passing by, cried out saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
And the crowd rebuked them that they should be silent. But they cried out all the more, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
And Jesus having stopped, called them and said, “What do you desire I should do unto you?”
They say to Him, “Lord, that our eyes might be opened.”
And having been moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they received sight, and they followed Him.
And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey having been tied, and a colt with her. Having untied them, bring them to Me,
and if anyone says anything to you, you will say that the Lord has need of them, and he will send them immediately.”
And this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
“Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your King comes to you, gentle and mounted on a donkey, even upon a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”
And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus commanded them,
brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks upon them, and He sat on them.
And the very great crowd spread their the cloaks on the road, and others were cutting down branches from the trees and were spreading them on the road.
And the crowds going before Him and those following were crying out, saying: “Hosanna to the Son of David!” “Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord!” “Hosanna in the highest!”
And of Him having entered into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, “Who is this?”
And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet, Jesus, the One from Nazareth of Galilee.”
And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling the doves.
And He says to them, “It has been written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer.’ But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”
And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
And the chief priests and the scribes, having seen the wonders that He did and the children crying out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” were indignant
and said to Him, “Do you hear what these say?” And Jesus says to them, “Yes, have you never read: ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings You have prepared for yourself praise’?”
And having left them, He went out of the city to Bethany, and He passed the night there.
And in the morning, having come back into the city, He became hungry.
And having seen one fig tree along the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except only leaves. And He says to it, “Never let there be any more fruit from you, to the age.” And the fig tree withered immediately.
And having seen it, the disciples marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”
And Jesus answering said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and not do doubt, you will do not only this of the fig tree, but even if you should say to this mountain, ‘Be you taken away and be you cast into the sea,’ it will come to pass.
And all things, as many as you might ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”
And of Him having come into the temple, teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him, saying, “By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave to You this authority?”
And Jesus answering, said to them, “I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will say to you by what authority I do these things.
From where was the baptism of John? From heaven, or from men?” And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘from heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
But if we should say, ‘from men,’ we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.”
And answering Jesus, they said “We do not know.” And He said to them, “Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
But what do you think? A man had two sons, and having come to the first he said, ‘Son, go work in the vineyard today.’
And answering he said, ‘I will not.’ But afterward, having repented, he went.
And having come to the second, he said likewise. And answering he said, ‘I will sir,’ and he did not go.
Which of the two did the will of the father?” They say, “The first.” Jesus says to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go before you into the kingdom of God.
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and you having seen, did not even repent afterward to believe him.
Hear another parable: There was a man, a master of a house, who planted a vineyard, and placed around it a fence, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he rented it out to farmers and traveled abroad.
And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruits.
And the farmers having taken his servants, one they beat, and one they killed, and one they stoned.
Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.
And afterward he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
But the farmers having seen the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and gain possession of his inheritance.’
And having taking him, they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Therefore when the master of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those farmers?”
They say to him, “He will destroy them, the wretches, grievously, and he will rent out the vineyard to other farmers who will give to him the fruits in their seasons.”
Jesus says to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone that those building rejected, this has become the chief corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
Because of this I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a people producing its fruits.
And the one having fallen on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.”
And the chief priests and the Pharisees, having heard His parables, knew that He speaks about them.
And seeking to lay hold of Him, they feared the crowds, because they were holding Him as a prophet.
And answering, Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,
“The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man, a king, who made a wedding feast for his son.
And he sent his servants to call those having been invited to the wedding feast—and they were not willing to come.
Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Say to those having been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and the fatlings have been killed, and all things are ready; come to the wedding feast.”’
And having paid no attention they went away, one to the own field, and one to his business.
And the rest, having laid hold of his servants, mistreated and killed them.
And the king was angry, and having sent his armies, he destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Then he says to his servants, ‘Indeed the wedding feast is ready, but those having been invited were not worthy.
Therefore go into the thoroughfares of the highways, and invite to the wedding feast as many as you shall find.’
And those servants, having gone out into the highways, brought together all, as many as they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall became full of those reclining.
And the king having entered in to see those reclining, he beheld a man there not being dressed in wedding clothes.
And he says to him, ‘Friend, how did you enter here not having a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.
Then the king said to the servants, ‘Having bound his hands and feet, cast him out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.’
For many are called, but few chosen.”
Then the Pharisees having gone out, took counsel how they might trap Him in His words.
And they send their disciples to Him, with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and You teach the way of God in the truth, and to You there is care about no one, for You do not look on the appearance of men.
Therefore tell us, what do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?”
But having known their malice, Jesus said, “Hypocrites, why do you test Me?
Show Me the coin of the tribute.” And they presented to Him a denarius.
And He says to them, “Whose likeness and whose inscription is this?”
They say to Him, “Caesar’s.” Then He says to them, “Therefore give back to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God.”
And having heard, they marveled. And having left Him, they went away.
On that day Sadducees, those saying there is no resurrection, came to Him, and they questioned Him,
saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If anyone should die not having children, his brother will marry his wife and will raise up offspring for his brother.’
Now there were seven brothers among us; and the first died, and having married not having seed, he left his wife to his brother.
Likewise also the second, and the third, unto the seventh.
And last of all, the woman died.
In the resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven will she be wife? For all had her.”
And, Jesus answering said to them, “You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection, neither do they marry, nor are given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.
And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which has been spoken to you by God, saying,
‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?’ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
And the crowds having heard, were astonished at His teaching.
And the Pharisees, having heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, were gathered together the same.
And one of them, a lawyer, questioned Him, testing Him,
“Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?”
And He said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’
This is the great and first commandment.
And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”
And the Pharisees having been assembled together, Jesus questioned them,
saying, “What do you think concerning the Christ? Of whom is He son?” They say to Him, “Of David.”
He says to them, “How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying:
‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, until I place Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.”’
If therefore David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?”
And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question Him any longer.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees have sat down on Moses’ seat;
therefore keep and observe all things whatsoever they might tell you. But do not do according to their works, for they preach and do not act.
And they tie up burdens heavy and hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders of men; but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.
And they do all their deeds in order to be seen by men. For they broaden their phylacteries and enlarge their tassels,
and they love the chief place at the banquets, and the first seats in the synagogues,
and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by men.
But you shall not be called ‘Rabbi,’ for your Teacher is One, and you are all brothers.
And call no one your father on the earth; for One is your Father, who is in heaven.
Neither be called instructors; since One is your instructor, the Christ.
But the greatest among you will be your servant.
And whoever shall exalt himself will be humbled, and whoever shall humble himself will be exalted.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men. For you neither enter, nor even do you allow those who are entering to go in.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse the sea and the dry land to make one convert, and whenever it may happen, you make him twofold more a son of Gehenna than yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides, those saying, ‘Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath.’
Foolish and blind! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple having sanctified the gold?
And you say, ‘Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it is bound by his oath.’
Blind! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar sanctifying the gift?
Therefore the one having sworn by the altar swears by it and by all things that are upon it.
And the one having sworn by the temple swears by it and by the One dwelling in it.
And the one having sworn by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the One sitting upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and you have neglected the weightier things of the Law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. It behooved you to do these, and not to be leaving aside those.
Blind guides—those straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of greed and intemperance.
Blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and of the dish, that their outside might become clean also.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like tombs having been whitewashed, which indeed outwardly appear beautiful, but inside they are full of bones of the dead, and of all impurity.
Thus indeed outwardly you also appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous;
and you say, ‘If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.’
Thus you bear witness to yourselves that you are sons of those having murdered the prophets.
You, then, fill up the measure of your fathers.
Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How shall you escape from the sentence of Gehenna?
Because of this, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and will crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues, and will persecute from town to town;
so that upon you shall come all the righteous blood being poured out upon the earth, from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those having been sent to her! How often would I have gathered together your children, the way in which a hen gathers together her chicks under the wings, and you were not willing!
Behold, your house is left to you desolate!
For I say to you, you shall not see Me from now until you say, ‘Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord.’”
And having gone forth from the temple, Jesus was going away, and His disciples came to Him to point out to Him the buildings of the temple.
And answering, He said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, no not even a stone shall be left here upon a stone, which will not be thrown down.”
And as He was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him in private, saying, “Tell us, when these things will be? And what is the sign of Your coming, and the consummation of the age?”
And Jesus answering, said to them, “Take heed, lest anyone mislead you.
For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will mislead many.
And you will begin to hear of wars and rumors of wars. Behold, do not be alarmed; for it is necessary to take place, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
And all these are the beginning of birth pains.
Then will they deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of My name.
And then many will fall away, and they will betray one another, and will hate one another;
and many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.
And because lawlessness is to be multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold.
But the one having endured to the end, he will be saved.
And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole earth, for a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come.
Therefore when you shall see ‘the abomination of desolation,’ having been spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place—the one reading, let him understand—
then those in Judea, let them flee to the mountains;
the one on the housetop, do not let him come down to take anything out of his house;
and the one in the field, do not let him return back to take his cloak.
And woe to those having in womb, and to the ones nursing infants in those days!
But pray that your flight might not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath.
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, and never shall be.
And unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved; but because of the elect, those days will be shortened.
Then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘Here,’ do not believe it.
For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
Behold, I have foretold you.
Therefore if they say to you, ‘Behold, He is in the wilderness,’ do not go forth; or ‘Behold, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe.
For just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
For wherever the carcass may be, there the vultures will be gathered.
And immediately after the tribulation of those days: ‘The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.’
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.
And He will send His angels with a great trumpet call, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to the ends thereof.
Now learn the parable of the fig tree: When its branch already may have become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that the summer is near.
So also you, when you see all these things, know that He is near, at the doors.
Truly I say to you that this generation will not have passed away until all these things shall have taken place.
The heaven and the earth will pass away, but My words shall not pass away.
But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens, nor the Son, except the Father only.
For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
For as in those days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until that day Noah entered into the ark,
and they were unaware until the flood came and took away all; so also will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Then two will be in the field: one is taken, and one is left.
Two women will be grinding at the mill: one is taken, and one is left.
Therefore keep watch, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes.
And know this, that if the master of the house had known in what time of night the thief comes, he would have watched and not have allowed his house to be broken into.
Because of this, you also be ready, for the Son of Man comes in that hour you do not expect.
Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has set over his household, to give to them the food in season?
Blessed is that servant whom his master, having come, will find thus doing.
Truly I say to you that he will set him over all of his possessing.
But if that evil servant should say in his heart, ‘My master delays,’
and should begin to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and to drink with those being drunkards,
the master of that servant will come in a day in which he does not expect, and in an hour which he is unaware,
and will cut him in pieces, and will appoint his place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who, having taken their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom.
And five of them were foolish, and five wise.
For the foolish, having taken their lamps, took no oil with them;
but the wise took oil in vessels with their lamps.
And the bridegroom tarrying, they all became drowsy and were sleeping.
And at the middle of the night, there was a cry: ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!’
Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’
And the wise answered, saying, ‘No, lest it might not suffice for us and you. Go rather to those selling, and buy for yourselves.’
And while they are going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those ready went in with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut.
And afterward, the other virgins come also, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’
And answering he said, ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know you.’
Therefore watch, for you do not know the day, nor the hour.
For it is like a man going on a journey who called his own servants and delivered his possessing to them.
And indeed to one he gave five talents; and to one, two; and to one, one; to each according to his own ability. And he left the region immediately.
The one having received the five talents, having gone, traded with them, and made five more.
Likewise, the one with the two gained two more.
But the one having received the one talent, having gone away, dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.
And after much time, the master of those servants comes and takes account with them.
And the one having received the five talents, having come, brought to him five other talents, saying, ‘Master, you did deliver to me five talents. Behold, I have gained five talents more.’
His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’
And the one with the two talents, also having come said, ‘Master, you did deliver to me two talents. Behold, I have gained two talents more.’
His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’
And the one having received the one talent, having come, also said, ‘Master, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering from where you did not scatter.
And having been afraid, having gone away, I hid your talent in the ground. Behold, you have what is yours.’
And his master answering, said to him, ‘Wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter.
Therefore it behooved you to put my money to the bankers, and having come, I would have received my own with interest.
Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to the one having the ten talents.
For to everyone having will be given, and he will have in abundance. But the one not having, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
And cast out the worthless servant, into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
And when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit upon His throne of glory.
And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
And indeed He will set the sheep on His right hand, and the goats on His left.
Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, those being blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom having been prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I hungered, and you gave Me to eat; I thirsted, and you gave Me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in;
naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.’
Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungering, and fed You? Or thirsting, and gave You to drink?
And when did we see You a stranger, and took You in? Or naked, and clothed You?
And when did we see You ailing or in prison, and came to You?’
And the King answering, will say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did it to Me.’
Then also He will say to those on the left, ‘Depart from Me, those being cursed, into the eternal fire, having been prepared for the devil and his angels.
For I hungered, and you gave to Me nothing to eat; and I thirsted, and You gave Me nothing to drink;
I was a stranger, and You did not take Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.’
Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?’
Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither did you to Me.’
And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the righteous into eternal life.”
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, He said to His disciples,
“You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man is delivered over to be crucified.”
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who is called Caiaphas,
and they plotted together, in order that they might seize Jesus by guile and kill Him.
But they were saying, “Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people.”
And of Jesus having been in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
a woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil, and poured it on His head as He is reclining.
And the disciples having seen, became indignant, saying, “For what purpose is this waste?
For this could have been sold for much, and have been given to the poor.”
And Jesus having known, said to them, “Why do you cause trouble to the woman? For she did a beautiful work to Me.
For the poor you always have with you, but not always do you have Me.
For this woman, in pouring this fragrant oil on My body, did it for My burial.
Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel shall be proclaimed in the whole world, that which this woman did also will be spoken of, for a memorial of her.”
Then one of the Twelve, the one being called Judas Iscariot, having gone to the chief priests,
said, “What are you willing to give me, and I will betray Him to you?” And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time, he was seeking an opportunity that he might betray Him.
And on the first day of the unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Where do you desire we should prepare for You to eat the Passover?”
And He said, “Go into the city unto a certain man and tell him the Teacher says, ‘My time is near; I will keep the Passover with you with My disciples.’”
And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover.
And evening having arrived, He was reclining with the twelve disciples.
And as they were eating, He said to them, “Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.”
And being grieved exceedingly, they began, each one, to say to Him, “Is it I, Lord?”
And answering He said, “The one having dipped the hand in the dish with Me, he will betray Me.
Indeed the Son of Man goes as it has been written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would be better for him if that man had not been born.”
And Judas who was betraying Him, answering, said, “Is it I, Rabbi?” He says to him, “You have said.”
Now as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread and having blessed it, broke it, and having given it to the disciples, He said, “Take, eat; this is My body.”
And having taken the cup and having given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you.
For this is My blood of the covenant, being poured out for many, for forgiveness of sins.
And I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now until that the day when I drink it anew with you in the kingdom of My Father.”
And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Then Jesus says to them, “You all will fall away because of Me during this night. For it has been written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’
But I, after being raised, will go before you into Galilee.”
And Peter answering, said to Him, “If all will fall away because of You, I never will fall away.”
Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you, during this night, before the rooster crowing, you will deny Me three times.”
Peter says to Him, “Even if it were necessary for me to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the disciples said likewise.
Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and He says to the disciples, “Sit here until that having gone away over there, I shall pray.”
And having taken with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
Then He says to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with Me.”
And having gone forward a little, He fell upon His face, praying, and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as You.”
And He comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping. And He says to Peter, “So, were you not able to watch with Me one hour?
Watch and pray, that you do not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the flesh weak.”
Again for a second time having gone away, He prayed, saying, “My Father, if this is not possible to pass unless I drink it, Your will be done.”
And having come again, He finds them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
And having left them again, having gone away, He prayed for the third time, having said the same thing again.
Then He comes to the disciples and says to them, “Sleep and take your rest later on. Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Rise up, let us go! Behold, he who is betraying Me has drawn near!”
And as He is still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the Twelve, came, and with him great a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
And the one betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, “Whomever I shall kiss, it is He; seize Him.”
And having come up to Jesus immediately, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed Him.
And Jesus said to him, “Friend, for what are you come?” Then having approached, they laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.
And behold, one of those with Jesus, having stretched out the hand, drew his sword, and having struck the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.
Then Jesus says to him, “Return your sword into its place; for all those having taken the sword, will perish by the sword.
Or do you think that I am not able to call upon My Father, and He will furnish to Me presently more than twelve legions of angels?
How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?”
In that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, “Did you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to capture Me? Every day in the temple I was sitting, teaching, and you did not seize Me.
And all this is come to pass, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then the disciples all, having forsaken Him, fled.
And those having seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
And Peter was following Him from afar, even to the court of the high priest. And having entered within, he was sitting with the guards to see the outcome.
And the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false evidence against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death.
But they did not find any, of many false witnesses having come forward. And at last, two having come forward,
they said, “This man has been saying, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.’”
And the high priest having stood up, said to Him, “Answer you nothing? What do these witness against you?”
But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to Him, “I adjure you by the living God, that You tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.”
Jesus says to him, “You have said. But I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming upon the clouds of heaven.”
Then the high priest tears his garments, saying, “He has blasphemed; why do we have any more need of witnesses? Behold now, you have heard the blasphemy.
What do you think?” And answering they said, “He is deserving of death.”
Then they spat in His face and struck Him. And others slapped Him,
saying, “Prophesy to us, Christ, who is the one having struck You?”
And Peter was sitting outside in the court, and one servant girl came to him, saying, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”
And he denied it before all, saying, “I do not know what you say.”
And having gone out to the porch, another saw him, and says to those there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man.”
And after a little while those standing by having approached, said to Peter, “Surely you are of them also, for even your speech gives you away.”
Then he began to curse and to swear, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, He having said, “Before the rooster crowing, you will deny Me three times.” And having gone out, he wept bitterly.
And morning having arrived, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death.
And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor.
Then Judas, the one having delivered Him up, having seen that He was condemned, having regretted it, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
saying, “I sinned, having betrayed innocent blood.” And they said, “What is that to us? You will see.”
And having cast down the pieces of silver into the temple, he withdrew, and having gone away, hanged himself.
And the chief priests, having taken the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”
And having taken counsel, they bought with them the potter’s field, for a burial place for strangers.
Therefore that field was called Field of Blood, to this day.
Then was fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the One having been priced, whom they set a price on by the sons of Israel,
and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”
Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And Jesus said, “You say.”
And in His being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.
Then Pilate says to Him, “Do You not hear how many things they witness against You?”
And He did not answer him, not even to one word, so as to amaze the governor exceedingly.
And at the feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the multitude, whom they were wishing.
And at that time they were holding a notable prisoner called Barabbas.
Therefore of them being gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom want you that I shall release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?”
For he knew that they had delivered Him up through envy.
And as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Nothing to you and that righteous man; for I suffered many things in a dream today because of Him.”
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas, and should destroy Jesus.
And the governor answering said to them, “Which of the two do you desire that I release to you?” And they said, “Barabbas.”
Pilate says to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?” They all say, “Let Him be crucified.”
And he said, “For what evil did He commit?” And they kept crying out all the more, saying, “Let Him be crucified.”
And Pilate having seen that it availed nothing, but rather a riot is arising, having taken water, washed the hands before the crowd, saying, “I am guiltless of the blood of this man. For yourselves you will see.”
And all the people answering said, “His blood be on us, and on our children.”
Then he released Barabbas to them; and having flogged Jesus, He delivered Him up that He might be crucified.
Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus into the Praetorium, gathered the whole cohort before Him.
And having stripped Him, they put a scarlet robe around Him.
And having twisted together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and having bowed the knees before Him, they mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
And having spit upon Him, they took the reed and kept striking Him on His head.
And when they had mocked Him, they took off Him the robe, and they put His garments on Him and led away Him to crucify Him.
And going forth, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon. They compelled him that he might carry His cross.
And having come to a place called Golgotha, which is called Place of a Skull,
they gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall; and having tasted, He was not willing to drink it.
And having crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots.
And sitting down, they were guarding Him there.
And they put up over His head the written accusation against Him: this is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
At the same time two robbers are crucified with Him, one at the right hand, and one at the left.
And those passing by kept railing at Him, wagging their heads
and saying, “The One destroying the temple and building it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, also descend from the cross!”
Likewise also, the chief priests with the scribes and elders, mocking, were saying,
“He saved others. He is not able to save Himself. He is King of Israel! Let Him descend now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.
He trusted on God. Let Him deliver Him now if He wants. For He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”
And likewise even the robbers, those having been crucified with Him, were upbraiding Him.
And from the sixth hour, darkness was over all the land, until the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” That is, “My God, My God, why have you forsaken Me?”
And some of those who were standing there, having heard, began saying, “This man calls Elijah.”
And immediately one of them, having run and having taken a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar and having put it on a reed, gave Him to drink.
And the rest were saying, “Let it be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to save Him.”
And Jesus, having cried again in a loud voice, yielded up His spirit.
And behold, the veil of the temple was torn into two from top to bottom. And the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split.
And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints having fallen asleep arose.
And having gone forth out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
And the centurion and those with him keeping guard over Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things taking place, feared greatly, saying, “Truly this was God’s Son.”
And many women were there, looking on from afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him—
among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
And evening having arrived, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who himself also was discipled to Jesus.
Having gone to Pilate, he asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.
And Joseph having taken the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
and placed it in his new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he went away.
And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
And the next day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together before Pilate,
saying, “Sir, we have remembered how that deceiver, while living, said, ‘After three days I arise.’
Therefore command the tomb to be secured until the third day, lest ever His disciples having come, steal Him away and say to the people, ‘He is risen from the dead.’ And the last deception will be worse than the first.”
Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go make it as secure as you know how.”
And having gone with the guard, they made the tomb secure, having sealed the stone.
And after the Sabbaths, it being dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, having descended out of heaven and having come, rolled away the stone and was sitting upon it.
And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
And those keeping guard trembled from fear of him, and they became as dead men.
And the angel answering said to the women, “Fear not; for I know that you seek Jesus, the One having been crucified.
He is not here, for He is risen as He said! Come, see the place where He was lying.
And having gone quickly, say to His disciples that He is risen from the dead and behold, He goes before you into Galilee; you will see Him there. Behold, I have told you.”
And having gone out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to tell His disciples.
And behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” And having approached, they took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.
Then Jesus says to them, “Do not fear. Go, tell My brothers, so that they should go into Galilee, and there will they see Me.”
And while they were going, behold, some of the guard, having gone into the city, reported to the chief priests all the things having been done.
And having been gathered together with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave many silver pieces to the soldiers,
saying, “Say that His disciples, having come by night, stole Him—we being asleep.
And if this is heard by the governor, we will persuade him and will keep you out of trouble.”
And having taken the money, they did as they were instructed. And this report is spread abroad among the Jews until the present day.
And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus assigned them.
And having seen Him they worshiped; but some doubted.
And having come to them, Jesus spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on the earth has been given to Me.
Therefore having gone, disciple all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age.”
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, Son of God.
As it has been written in the prophet Isaiah: “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way.”
“The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His paths.’”
John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
And all the region of Judea and all of Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.
And John was clothed in camel’s hair and a belt of leather around his waist; and he is eating locusts and wild honey.
And he was preaching, saying, “He who comes after me is mightier than I, of whom I am not sufficient, having stooped down, to untie the strap of His sandals.
I baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.
And immediately going up from the water, he saw the heavens tearing open and the Spirit descending as a dove upon Him.
And a voice came out of the heavens: “You are My Son, the beloved; in You I am well pleased.”
And immediately the Spirit drives Him out into the wilderness.
And He was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And He was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to Him.
And after the delivering up of John, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God
and saying, “The time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near; repent and believe in the gospel.”
And passing by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, “Come after Me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.”
And immediately, having left the nets, they followed Him.
And having gone on a little, He saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, and they were in the boat mending the nets.
And immediately He called them, and having left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went away after Him.
And they go into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbaths, having entered into the synagogue, He was teaching.
And they were astonished at His teaching, for He was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
And immediately there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
saying, “What to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are, the Holy One of God!”
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come forth out of him!”
And having thrown him into convulsions, and having cried in a loud voice, the unclean spirit came forth out of him.
And all were astonished, so as to question among themselves, saying, “What is this new teaching? With authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!”
And news of Him immediately went out everywhere into all the surrounding region of Galilee.
And immediately having gone forth out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And the mother-in-law of Simon was laying sick fevering. And immediately they speak to Him about her.
And having come to her, He raised her up, having taken hold of the hand. And the fever left her, and she began to minister to them.
And evening having come, when the sun went down, they began bringing to Him all those being sick and those being possessed by demons.
And all the city was gathered together at the door.
And He healed many being sick of various diseases, and He cast out many demons. And He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.
And having risen up very early, still much in night, He went out and departed into a solitary place, and there He was praying.
And Simon and those with him went after Him.
And having found Him, also they say to Him, “Everyone seeks You!”
And He says to them, “Let us go another way into the neighboring towns, so that I might preach there also; for I have come forth for this.”
And He was going in all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.
And a leper comes to Him, imploring Him and kneeling down to Him, and saying to Him, “If You are willing, You are able to cleanse me.”
And having been moved with compassion, having stretched out His hand, He touched him and says to him, “I am willing, be cleansed.”
And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
And having sternly warned him, He sent him away immediately.
And He says to him, “See that you speak nothing to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”
But having gone out, he began to proclaim much and to spread abroad the matter, so that He was no longer able to enter openly into the city, but He was out in solitary places. And they were coming to Him from every quarter.
And He having entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that He is in the house.
And many were gathered together, so as to have no more space, not even at the door. And He was speaking the word to them.
And they come, bringing to Him a paralytic, being carried by four.
And not being able to come near to Him on account of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was, and having broken it up, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.
And Jesus, having seen their faith, says to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,
“Why does this man speak thus? He blasphemes! Who is able to forgive sins, except God alone?”
And immediately Jesus, having known in His spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, says to them, “Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your mat, and walk’?
But that you might know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on the earth...” He says to the paralytic,
“I say to you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your home.”
And he arose, and immediately, having taken up the mat, he went forth before all, so as for all to be amazed and to glorify God, saying, “Never did we see thus.”
And He went forth again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to Him, and He taught them.
And passing on, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and says to him, “Follow Me.” And having arisen, he followed Him.
And it came to pass in His reclining in his house, that many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they were following Him.
And the scribes of the Pharisees, having seen Him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, were saying to His disciples, “Why does He eat with the tax collectors and sinners?”
And Jesus having heard, says to them, “Those being strong have no need of a physician, but those being sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. And they come and say to Him, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”
And Jesus said to them, “Are the sons of the bridechamber able to fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long a time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.
But the days will come when the bridegroom will have been taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.
No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on old clothing. Otherwise the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear takes place.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wine will burst the wineskins, and the wine will be destroyed—and the wineskins. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.”
And it came to pass, He is passing through the grainfields on the Sabbaths, and His disciples began to make their way, plucking the heads of grain.
And the Pharisees were saying to Him, “Behold, why do they that which is unlawful on the Sabbaths?”
And He said to them, “Did you never read what David did when he had need, and he and those with him hungered—
how he entered into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the loaves of the presentation, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests—and he even gave to those being with him?”
And He said to them, “The Sabbath was made on account of the man, and not the man on account of the Sabbath.
So then, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
And He entered into the synagogue again, and a man having a withered hand was there.
And they were watching Him, whether He will heal him on the Sabbaths, in order that they might accuse Him.
And He says to the man having the withered hand, “Arise into the midst.”
And He says to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbaths to do good, or to do evil, to save life, or to kill?” But they were silent.
And having looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their heart, He says to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
And the Pharisees having gone out, immediately began to take counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.
And Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed, and from Judea,
and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude came to Him, having heard how much He was doing.
And He spoke to His disciples, that a boat might wait upon Him, on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon Him.
For He healed many, so as for as many as had diseases to press upon Him, that they might touch Him.
And the unclean spirits, whenever they beheld Him, were falling down before Him and crying out, saying, “You are the Son of God.”
And He would rebuke them much, so that they should not make Him known.
And He goes up on the mountain and calls near those whom He Himself wanted, and they went to Him.
And He appointed twelve ones, and He called them apostles, that they might be with Him, and that He might send them to preach,
and to have authority to cast out demons.
And He appointed the Twelve; and to Simon He added the name Peter;
and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and He added to them the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder;
and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,
and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
And He comes to a house, and a crowd comes together again, so that not even are they able to eat bread.
And those belonging to Him having heard, went out to seize Him; for they were saying, “He is out of His mind.”
And the scribes, those having come down from Jerusalem, were saying, “He has Beelzebul,” and “By the prince of the demons He casts out the demons.”
And having called them to Him, He began speaking to them in parables: “How is Satan able to cast out Satan?
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.
And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
And if Satan has risen up against himself and has been divided, he is not able to stand, but is coming to an end.
But no one is able, having entered into the house of the strong man, to plunder his goods, unless first he binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.
Truly I say to you that all sins and blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men, as many as they shall have blasphemed.
But whoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness, to the age, but is guilty of eternal sin.”
For they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
And His mother and His brothers arrive, and standing outside, sent to Him, calling Him.
And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers outside are seeking You.”
And He answering them says, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”
And having looked around on those who were sitting around Him in a circle, He says, “Behold, My mother and My brothers!
For whoever shall do the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother.”
And again He began to teach beside the sea. And a great crowd was gathered together to Him, so that He, having entered into a boat, sat in the sea, and all the crowd was on the land, close to the sea.
And He began teaching them many things in parables, and in His teaching He was saying to them,
“Listen! Behold, the one sowing went out to sow.
And it came to pass as he sowed, some fell along the road, and the birds came and devoured it.
And other fell upon the rocky place where it had not much soil, and it sprang up immediately, because of not having depth of soil.
And after the sun rose, it was scorched, and because of not having root, it withered away.
And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
And other fell into the good soil and began yielding fruit, growing up and increasing, and one bearing thirtyfold, and one sixty, and one a hundred.”
And He was saying, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
And when He was alone, those around Him with the Twelve began asking Him about the parable.
And He was saying to them, “To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, everything is done in parables,
so that, ‘Seeing, they might see and not perceive; and hearing, they might hear and not understand; lest ever they should turn, and they should be forgiven.’”
And He says to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables?
The one sowing sows the word.
And these are those along the road, where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word having been sown in them.
And these are likewise those sown upon the rocky places, who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy,
and they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then tribulation or persecution having arisen on account of the word, immediately they fall away.
And these are those sown among the thorns. These are those having heard the word,
and the cares of this age and the deceit of riches, and the desires of the other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
And these are those having been sown upon the good soil, such as hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit: one thirtyfold, and one sixty, and one a hundred.”
And He was saying to them, “The lamp is not brought in so that it might be put under the basket, or under the bed. Is it not that it might be put upon the lampstand?
For there is nothing which is hidden except that it should be made manifest; nor has taken place a secret thing, but that it should come to light.
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”
And He was saying to them, “Take heed what you hear. With what measure you measure it will be measured to you, and more will be added to you.
For whoever may have, it will be given to him; and he who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”
And He was saying, “The kingdom of God is thus, as a man should cast the seed upon the earth,
and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow—he not knows how.
Of itself, the earth brings forth fruit—first a plant, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.
And when the fruit offers itself, he sends the sickle immediately, for the harvest has come.”
And He was saying, “To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we present it?
As a grain of mustard, which, when it has been sown upon the earth, is smallest of all the seeds that are upon the earth,
and when it has been sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all the garden plants, and produces great branches, so that the birds of the air are able to encamp under its shadow.”
And with many such parables He kept speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear,
and He would not speak to them without parables; but privately He would explain all things to His own disciples.
And on that day, evening having come, He says to them, “Let us pass over to the other side.”
And having dismissed the crowd, they take Him with them since He was in the boat; and other boats were with Him.
And a violent storm of wind comes, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that the boat already is being filled up.
And He was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. And they awaken Him and say to Him, “Teacher, is it no concern to You that we perish?”
And having been awoken, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Silence, be still!” And the wind abated, and there was a great calm.
And He said to them, “Why are you fearful? Have you still no faith?”
And they feared with great fear and were saying to each other, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”
And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.
And of Him having gone forth out of the boat, immediately out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit met Him,
who had the dwelling in the tombs. And no longer was anyone able to bind him, not even with chains,
because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn in two by him, and the shackles had been shattered, and no one was able to subdue him.
And constantly all night and day in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.
And having seen Jesus from afar, he ran and fell on his knees before Him.
And having cried in a loud voice, he said, “What to me and to You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me.”
For He was saying to him, “You come forth out of the man, unclean spirit!”
And He was asking him, “What is your name?” And he answered saying, “My name is Legion, because we are many.”
And he begged Him numerous times that He would not send them out of the country.
Now there was a great herd of pigs there near the mountain, feeding.
And they begged Him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, so that we may enter into them.”
And He allowed them. And the unclean spirits having gone out, entered into the pigs, and the herd—about two thousand—rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.
And those feeding them fled and proclaimed it to the city and to the country. And they went out to see what it is that has been done.
And they come to Jesus and see the man possessed by demons sitting, clothed and sound minded—the one having had the legion—and they were afraid.
And those having seen it related to them how it happened to the one being possessed by demons, and concerning the pigs.
And they began to implore Him to depart from their region.
And He having entered into the boat, the one having been possessed by demons was begging Him that he might be with Him.
And He did not permit him, but He says to him, “Go to your home, to your own, and preach to them how much the Lord did for you and had mercy on you.”
And he departed and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all were marveling.
And Jesus having passed over again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd was gathered to Him, and He was beside the sea.
And one of the synagogue rulers comes, named Jairus, and having seen Him, falls at His feet,
and he begs Him much, saying, “My little daughter is holding at the end, that having come, You would lay the hands on her, so that she might be cured, and she shall live.”
And He departed with him. And a great crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him.
And a woman, being with a flux of blood twelve years,
and having suffered much under many physicians and having spent everything of hers, and having benefited in no way, but rather to the worse having come,
having heard concerning Jesus, having come up in the crowd behind, she touched His clothing.
For she was saying, “If I shall touch even His garments, I will be healed.”
And immediately her flow of blood was dried up, and she knew in the body that she was healed from the affliction.
And immediately Jesus, having known in Himself the power having gone forth out of Him, having turned in the crowd, said, “Who touched My garments?”
And His disciples were saying to Him, “You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’”
And He was looking around to see the one having done this.
And the woman, having been frightened and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before Him, and told Him the whole truth.
And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you; go in peace and be sound from your affliction.”
While yet He is speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, “Your daughter is dead; why do you trouble the Teacher still?”
But Jesus, having heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not fear; only believe.”
And He did not allow anyone to follow with Him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and He beholds a commotion, and much weeping and wailing.
And having entered, He says to them, “Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeps.”
And they were laughing at Him. And He, having put all outside, takes with Him the father and the mother of the child, and those with Him, and enters in where the child was.
And having taken the hand of the child, He says to her, “Talitha, koum!” which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, arise!”
And immediately the girl arose and began walking, for she was twelve of years. And immediately they were overcome with great amazement.
And He instructed them strictly that no one should know this; and He commanded to be given to her to eat.
And He went out from there and came into His hometown; and His disciples follow Him.
And the Sabbath having come, He began to teach in the synagogue; and many hearing were astonished, saying, “From where to this man are these things, and what is the wisdom having been given to Him, even the miracles such as are done by His hands?
Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?” And they took offense at Him.
And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his household.”
And He was not able to do any work of power there, except having laid the hands on a few sick, He healed them.
And He was amazed because of their unbelief. And He was going around the villages, teaching.
And He calls to Him the Twelve, and He began to send them forth two by two, and He gave to them authority over the unclean spirits.
And He instructed them that they should take nothing for the journey, except only a staff—no bread, nor bag, nor money in the belt—
but wearing sandals, and do not put on two tunics.
And He would say to them, “Wherever you enter into a house, remain there until you go out from there.
And if any place will not receive you nor hear you, departing from there, shake off the dust which is under your feet, for a testimony against them.”
And having gone out, they preached that they should repent.
And they were casting out many demons, and were anointing many sick with oil, and healing them.
And King Herod heard; for His name became well known. And people were saying, “John, the one baptizing, is risen out from the dead, and because of this the miraculous powers operate in him.”
But others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and others were saying, “A prophet, like one of the prophets.”
And Herod having heard, was saying, “John, whom I beheaded—he is risen!”
For Herod himself, having sent, seized John, and bound him in prison, on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.
For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”
And Herodias held it against him, and wished to kill him, and was not able.
For Herod was afraid of John, knowing him a righteous and holy man; and he kept him safe. And having heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and heard him gladly.
And an opportune day having come, when Herod on his birthday made a banquet to his great men, and to the chief captains, and to the leading men of Galilee,
and the daughter of Herodias herself having come in, and having danced, pleased Herod and those reclining with him. And the king said the to the girl, “Ask me whatever you wish, and I will give to you.”
And he swore to her, “Whatever you might ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”
And she having gone out, said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” And she said, “The head of John the one baptizing.”
And having entered immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying, “I desire that you give to me the head of John the Baptist upon a platter at once.”
And the king, having been made very sorrowful, on account of the oaths and those reclining with him, did not want to refuse her.
And immediately the king, having sent an executioner, commanded to be brought his head. And having gone, he beheaded him in the prison,
and brought his head upon a platter, and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
And his disciples having heard it, came and took up his body, and laid it in a tomb.
And the apostles are gathered together to Jesus, and they related to him all things, what they had done and what they had taught.
And He said to them, “You yourselves come apart to a solitary place, and rest a little.” For those coming and those going were many, and not even did they have opportunity to eat.
And they went away by the boat into a solitary place by themselves.
And many saw them going, and recognized, and ran together there on foot from all the cities, and went before them.
And having gone out, He saw a great crowd and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.
And the hour already being late, having come to Him, his disciples were saying, “The place is desolate, and the hour already is late.
Dismiss them, that having gone to the surrounding region and villages, they might buy for themselves something to eat.”
But answering, He said to them, “You give to them to eat.” And they say to Him, “Having gone, shall we buy two hundred denarii of bread and give them to eat?”
And He says to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go, see.” And having known, they say, “Five, and two fish.”
And He commanded them to make them all recline, groups by groups, on the green grass.
And they sat down groups by groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
And having taken the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to the heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and He kept giving them to His disciples, that they might set before them. And He divided the two fish among all.
And all ate and were satisfied.
And they took up twelve hand-baskets full of fragments, and also of the fish.
And those having eaten of the loaves were five thousand men.
And immediately He compelled His disciples to enter into the boat and to go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, until He should dismiss the crowd.
And having taken leave of them, He departed into the mountain to pray.
And evening having come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and He alone upon the land.
And He having seen them straining in the rowing—for the wind was contrary to them—about the fourth watch of the night, He comes to them, walking on the sea, and He was wishing to pass by them.
And having seen Him walking on the sea, they thought that it is a ghost, and cried out.
For all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He spoke with them, and says to them, “Take courage; I am He; fear not.”
And He went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased. And exceedingly in abundance they were amazed in themselves,
for they had not understood about the loaves, but their heart had been hardened.
And having passed over, they came to the land, to Gennesaret, and drew to shore.
And of them having come out of the boat, having recognized Him immediately,
they ran through all that country, and they began to carry about on mats those being sick to wherever they were hearing that He is.
And wherever He entered into villages or into cities or into fields, they were laying the ailing in the marketplaces and were begging Him that only they might touch the fringe His clothing; and as many as touched Him were being healed.
And the Pharisees and some of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem, are gathered together to Him.
And they had seen that some of His disciples are eating the bread with defiled, that is, unwashed hands.
For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash the hands carefully, holding the tradition of the elders;
and on coming from the market, they do not eat unless they wash; and there are many other things which they received, for them to hold to—washings of cups and vessels and utensils and couches for dining.
And the Pharisees and the scribes questioned Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat the bread with unwashed hands?”
And He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied rightly concerning you hypocrites, as it has been written: ‘This people honors Me with the lips, but their heart is kept far away from Me;
and they worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’
Having neglected the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.”
And He was saying to them, “Neatly do you set aside the commandment of God, that you might keep your tradition.
For Moses said, ‘Honor your Father and your mother,’ and, ‘The one speaking evil of father or mother must surely die.’
But you say that if a man says to the father or the mother, ‘Whatever you might be profited from me, it is Corban,’ that is, a gift,
no longer do you permit him to do anything for the father or the mother,
making void the word of God for your tradition, which you have handed down. And you do many things like such.”
And having summoned the crowd again, He was saying to them, “Listen to Me, all, and understand:
There is nothing from outside the man entering into him which is able to defile him; but the things proceeding out of the man are the things defiling the man.”

And when He went into the house from the crowd, His disciples were asking Him the parable.
And He says to them, “Thus are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything entering into the man from outside is not able to defile him,
because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the sewer?” (Thus purifying all foods.)
And He was saying, “That going forth out of the man, that defiles the man.
For from within the heart of men go forth evil thoughts, sexual immorality, thefts, murders, adulteries,
covetous desires, wickednesses, deceit, sensuality, an evil eye, slander, pride, foolishness.
All these evils go forth from within, and they defile the man.”
And from there having risen up, He went away into the region of Tyre. And having entered into a house, He was wishing no one to know it, but He was not able to be hidden.
But immediately, having heard about Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at His feet.
Now the woman was Gentile, Syrophoenician by race, and kept asking Him that He should cast forth the demon out of her daughter.
And He was saying to her, “Permit the children to be satisfied first; for it is not good to take the children’s bread and to cast it to the dogs.”
But she answered and says to Him, “Yes, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.”
And He said to her, “Because of this word, go; the demon has gone forth out of your daughter.”
And having gone away to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, and the demon having gone out.
And again having departed from the region of Tyre, He came through Sidon, to the Sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of the Decapolis.
And they bring to Him a man who was deaf and who spoke with difficulty, and they implore Him that He might lay the hand on him.
And having taken him away from the crowd privately, He put His fingers to his ears, and having spit, He touched his tongue,
and having looked up to heaven He sighed deeply, and He says to him, “Ephphatha!” (that is, “Be opened!”).
And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed, and he began speaking plainly.
And He instructed them that they should tell no one. But as much as He kept instructing them, they were proclaiming it more abundantly.
And they were astonished above measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.”
In those days, of the crowd again being great and not having what they might eat, having summoned the disciples, He says to them,
“I am moved with compassion upon the crowd, because they continue with Me three days already, and have nothing that they might eat.
And if I shall send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. For some of them are come from afar.”
And His disciples answered Him, “From where will anyone be able to satisfy these with bread, here in this desolate place?”
And He was asking them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven.”
And He directs the crowd to recline on the ground. And having taken the seven loaves, having given thanks, He broke them and kept giving them to His disciples, that they might set before them. And they set it before the crowd.
And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, He ordered these also to be set before them.
And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets of fragments over and above.
And there were about four thousand. And He sent them away.
And immediately having entered into the boat with His disciples, He came into the district of Dalmanutha.
And the Pharisees went out and began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him.
And having sighed deeply in His spirit, He says, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”
And having left them, having embarked again, He went away to the other side.
And they forgot to take loaves, and except one loaf, they did not have any with them in the boat.
And He was instructing them, saying, “Watch out! Take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”
And they were reasoning with one another because they had no loaves.
And having known, He says to them, “Why do you reason because you have no loaves? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Do you have your heart hardened?
‘Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?’ And do you not remember?
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many hand-baskets full of fragments did you take up?” They say to Him, “Twelve.”
“And when the seven were to the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?” And they said, “Seven.”
And He was saying to them, “Do you not yet understand?”
And they come to Bethsaida. And they bring to Him a blind man and implore Him that He might touch him.
And having taken hold of the hand of the blind man, He led him forth out of the village, and having spit upon his eyes, having laid the hands upon him, He was asking him if you see anything.
And having looked up, he was saying, “I see the men, for I see them as trees walking.”
Then He laid the hands upon his eyes again, and he opened his eyes and was restored, and he began to see everything clearly.
And He sent him to his home, saying, “You may not enter into the village.”
And Jesus and His disciples went forth into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way, He was questioning His disciples, saying to them, “Whom do men pronounce Me to be?”
And they answered Him, saying, “John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”
And He was questioning them, “But whom do you pronounce Me to be?” Peter answering, says to Him, “You are the Christ.”
And He warned them that they should tell no one concerning Him.
And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again.
And He was speaking openly the word. And Peter having taken Him to him, began to rebuke Him.
And having turned and having looked upon His disciples, He rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind Me, Satan, for your thoughts are not of the things of God, but the things of men.”
And having summoned the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and let him take up his cross, and let him follow Me.
For whoever might desire to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life on account of Me and of the gospel, he will save it.
For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and to lose his soul?
For what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul?
For whoever may be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when He shall come in the glory of His Father, with the holy angels.”
And He was saying to them, “Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God having come with power.”
And after six days, Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John, and brings them up into a high mountain by themselves alone. And He was transfigured before them,
and His garments became exceedingly shining white, such as no launderer on the earth is able thus to whiten.
And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
And Peter answering, says to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
For he did not know what he should say; for they were terrified.
And there came a cloud overshadowing them, and there came a voice out of the cloud: “This is My Son, the beloved; listen to Him.”
And suddenly, having looked around, no longer did they see anyone with them, except Jesus alone.
And as they were descending from the mountain, He instructed them that they should tell to no one what they had seen, except until the Son of Man had risen out from the dead.
And they kept that saying among themselves, questioning what it is to rise out from the dead.
And they were asking Him, saying, “The scribes say that it behooves Elijah to come first.”
And He was saying to them, “Elijah indeed, having come first, restores all things; and how has it been written of the Son of Man, that He should suffer many things and be set at naught?
But I say to you, that also Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they desired, as it has been written of him.”
And having come to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.
And immediately the whole crowd, having seen Him, were greatly amazed, and running to Him, were greeting Him.
And He asked them, “What are you disputing with them?”
And one out of the crowd answered Him, “Teacher, I brought to You my son, having a mute spirit;
and whenever it seizes him, it throws him down; and he foams and gnashes his teeth, and is withering away. And I spoke to Your disciples, that they might cast it out, and they had no power.”
And answering him He says, “O unbelieving generation! Until when will I be with you? Until when will I bear with you? Bring him to Me.”
And they brought him to Him. And having seen Him, the spirit immediately threw him into convulsions, and having fallen upon the ground, he began rolling around, foaming.
And He asked his father, “How long a time is it that this has been with him?” And he said, “From childhood.
And often it casts him both into fire and into waters, that it might destroy him. But if You are able to do anything, having compassion on us, help us.”
And Jesus said to him, “If You are able? All things are possible to the one believing.”
Immediately the father of the child, having cried out, was saying, “I believe; help my unbelief!”
And Jesus, having seen that a crowd was running together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and you may enter into him no more.”
And it came out, having cried out and having thrown him into many convulsions; and he became as if dead, in order for many to say that he was dead.
And Jesus, having taken him by the hand, raised him up, and he arose.
And He having entered into the house, His disciples were asking Him in private, “Why were we not able to cast it out?”
And He said to them, “This kind is able to go out by nothing except by prayer.”
Having gone forth from there, they were passing through Galilee; and He did not want that anyone should know,
for He was teaching His disciples. And He was saying to them, “The Son of Man is delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and having been killed, on the third day He will arise.”
And they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask Him.
And they came to Capernaum. And having been in the house, He was asking them, “What were you discussing on the way?”
And they were silent, for along the road they had been discussing with one another which was greatest.
And having sat down, He called the Twelve, and He says to them, “If anyone desires to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.”
And having taken a child, He set it in the midst of them; and having taken it in His arms, He said to them,
“Whoever shall receive one of such little children in My name, receives Me; and whoever shall receive Me, does not receive Me, but the One having sent Me.”
John answered Him, “Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name, and we were forbidding him, because he was not following us.”
And Jesus said, “Do not forbid him. For there is no one who will do a work of power in My name, and will be able readily to speak evil of Me.
For whoever is not against us is for us.
For whoever might give you to drink a cup of water because you are Christ’s in name, truly I say to you, that he shall certainly not lose his reward.
And whoever might cause to stumble one of these little ones believing in Me, it is better for him rather if a heavy millstone is put around his neck, and he has been cast into the sea.
And if your hand should cause you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life crippled, than having two hands to go away into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire.

And if your foot should cause you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life lame, than having the two feet, to be cast into Gehenna.

And if your eye should cause you to stumble, cast it out; it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes, to be cast into Gehenna,
where ‘their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.’
For everyone will be salted with fire.
The salt is good, but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”
And from there having risen up, He comes into the region of Judea, and beyond the Jordan. And again crowds come together to Him, and again, as He had been accustomed, He was teaching them.
And the Pharisees, having approached, were demanding of Him if it is lawful for a husband to divorce a wife, testing Him.
And He answering said to them, “What did Moses command you?”
And they said, “Moses permitted to write a roll of divorce, and to send her away.”
But Jesus said to them, “He wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart;
but from the beginning of creation, ‘He made them male and female.’
‘On account of this, a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,
and the two will be for one flesh.’ Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh.
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.”
And in the house again, the disciples were asking Him concerning this.
And He says to them, “Whoever shall divorce his wife, and shall marry another, commits adultery against her.
And if a woman, having divorced her husband, should marry another, she commits adultery.”
And they were bringing little children to Him, that He might touch them. But the disciples rebuked them.
And having seen, Jesus was indignant and said to them, “Permit the little children to come to Me; do not hinder them! For to such belongs the kingdom of God.
Truly I say to you, whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall never enter into it.”
And having taken them in arms, He was blessing them, having laid the hands on them.
And going forth on His journey, one having run up and having knelt down to Him, was asking Him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do that I might inherit eternal life?”
And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good, except God alone.
You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, you shall not defraud, you shall honor your father and mother.’”
And he was saying to Him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.”
And Jesus, having looked upon him, loved him and said to him, “One thing to you is lacking: Go, sell as much as you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”
And having been sad at the word, he went away grieving; for he was one having many possessions.
And Jesus having looked around, says to His disciples, “How difficultly those having riches will enter into the kingdom of God!”
And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answering says to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God!
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”
And they were exceedingly astonished, saying among themselves, “Then who is able to be saved?”
Having looked on them, Jesus says, “With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.”
Peter began to say to Him, “Behold, we have left all and followed You.”
Jesus was saying, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands for My sake and because of the gospel,
who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions—and in the age which is coming, eternal life.
But many first will be last; and the last, first.”
And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on before them. And they were astonished, and those following were afraid. And having taken to Him the Twelve again, He began to tell them the things being about to happen to Him:
“Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, and will betray Him to the Gentiles.
And they will mock Him, and will spit upon Him, and will flog and will kill Him, and on the third day He will rise again.”
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come up to Him saying to Him, “Teacher, we desire that You would do for us whatever we might ask you.”
And He said to them, “What do you desire Me to do for you?”
And they said to Him, “Grant to us that we might sit, one of us at Your right hand and one at Your left hand, in Your glory.”
And Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”
And they said to Him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup that I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized,
but to sit at My right hand or at My left hand, is not Mine to give, but to those for whom it has been prepared.”
And having heard this, the ten began to be indignant about James and John.
And Jesus having called them near, says to them, “You know that those being accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
But it shall not be thus among you. Instead, whoever desires to become great among you will be your servant,
and whoever desires to become first among you will be slave of all.
For even the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”
And they come to Jericho. And as He was going out from Jericho—and His disciples, and a large crowd—a blind beggar, Bartimaeus, son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road.
And having heard that it is Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and to say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.”
And many were rebuking him, that he should be silent; but he kept crying out much more, “Son of David, have mercy on me.”
And Jesus, having stopped, commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, “Take courage! Rise up! He calls you.”
And having cast away his cloak, having risen up, he came to Jesus.
And Jesus answering him says, “What do you desire I should do to you?” And the blind man said to Him, “Rabboni, that I may receive sight.”
And Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you.” And immediately he received sight and began following Him on the way.
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives, He sends two of His disciples
and says to them, “Go into the village before you, and immediately entering into it, you will find a colt having been tied, upon which no one of men has ever sat; having untied it, also bring it.
And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘Because the Lord has need of it, and He will send it back here soon.’”
And they departed and found the colt having been tied at the door outside, by the street. And they untied it,
and some of those standing there were saying to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”
And they spoke to them as Jesus had commanded, and they allowed them.
And they led the colt to Jesus, and they cast upon it their cloaks, and He sat on it.
And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others, branches having been cut down from the fields.
And those going before and those following were crying out: “Hosanna!” “Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord!”
“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, David!” “Hosanna in the highest!”
And He entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and having looked around on all things, the hour being already late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
And on the next day, they having gone out from Bethany, He was hungry.
And having seen a fig tree from afar, having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He will find anything on it. And having come to it, He found nothing except leaves; for it was not the season of figs.
And answering He said to it, “May no one eat the fruit of you, no more to the age.” And His disciples were listening.
And they come to Jerusalem. And having entered into the temple, He began to cast out those selling and those buying in the temple. And He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those selling doves.
And He would not permit that anyone should carry a vessel through the temple.
And He began teaching, and was saying to them, “Has it not been written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”
And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and they were seeking how they might destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him, for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching.
And when evening came, they were going forth out of the city.
And passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree having been dried up from the roots.
And Peter having remembered, says to Him, “Rabbi, look, the fig tree that You cursed is dried up.”
And Jesus answering, says to them, “Have faith from God.
Truly I say to you that whoever shall say to this mountain, ‘Be you taken away and be you cast into the sea,’ and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he says takes place, it will be done for him.
Because of this I say to you, all things whatever praying, you also ask, believe that you receive, and it will be to you.
And when you may stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive it, so that your Father in the heavens also might forgive you your trespasses.”

And they come again to Jerusalem. And as He is walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders come to Him.
And they were saying to Him, “By what authority are You doing these things? Or who gave You this authority, that You should do these things?”
And Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one thing, and you answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer Me.”
And they began reasoning with themselves, saying, “What should we say? If we should say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
But should we say, ‘From men’...” They were afraid of the people, for all were holding that John truly was a prophet.
And answering to Jesus, they say, “We do not know.” And Jesus says to them, “Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
And He began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard, and placed around it a fence, and dug a wine vat, and built a tower, and rented it out to farmers, and traveled abroad.
And he sent a servant to the farmers at the due time, that he might receive from the farmers from the fruit of the vineyard.
But having taken him, they beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
And again he sent to them another servant, and him they struck on the head, and treated shamefully.
And He sent another, and him they killed; also many others, indeed some beating, and some killing.
Yet having one beloved son, he sent him to them last, saying, ‘They will have respect for my son.’
But those farmers said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
And having taken him, they killed him, and cast him forth outside the vineyard.
What therefore will the master of the vineyard do? He will come and will destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.
Have you not even read this Scripture: ‘The stone which those building rejected, this has become the chief corner;
this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
And they were seeking to lay hold of Him, and yet they feared the crowd; for they knew that He had spoken the parable against them. And having left Him, they went away.
And they send some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him, that they might catch Him in discourse.
And having come, they say to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and to You there is no care about any one; for You do not look on the appearance of men, but teach the way of God on the basis of the truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? Should we pay or not pay?”
And knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, “Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius, that I might see it.”
And they brought it, and He says to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” And they said to Him, “Caesar’s.”
And Jesus said to them, “Give back to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God.” And they were amazed at Him.
And Sadducees, who say there is not a resurrection, come to Him. And they began questioning Him, saying,
“Teacher, Moses wrote for us, that if anyone’s brother should die and leave behind a wife and not leave children, that his brother should take the wife and raise up seed for his brother.
There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying, left no seed.
And the second took her, and died, not having left seed. And the third likewise.
And the seven left no seed. Last of all, the woman also died.
In the resurrection, when they rise, of which of them will she be wife? For the seven had her as wife.”
Jesus was saying to them, “Do you not err because of this, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God?
For when they rise out from the dead, neither do they marry, nor are given in marriage; but they are like angels in the heavens.
And concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses on the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?
He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You err greatly.”
And one of the scribes having come up, having heard them reasoning together, having seen that He answered them well, questioned Him, “Which commandment is the first of all?”
Jesus answered, “The foremost is, ‘Hear this O Israel: The Lord our God is One Lord,
and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’
The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is not another commandment greater than these.”
And the scribe said to Him, “Right, Teacher. You have spoken according to truth that He is One, and there is not another besides Him,
and to love Him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love the neighbor as oneself is more important than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
And Jesus, having seen him that he answered wisely, said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to question Him any longer.
And answering, Jesus was saying, teaching in the temple, “How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
David himself said by the Holy Spirit: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, until I place Your enemies as a footstool of Your feet.”’
David himself calls Him Lord. And from where is He his son?” And the great crowd was listening to Him gladly.
And in His teaching He was saying, “Beware of the scribes, desiring to walk about in robes, and greetings in the marketplaces,
and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at the feasts;
those devouring the houses of widows, and praying at great length as a pretext. These will receive greater judgment.”
And having sat down opposite the treasury, He was watching how the crowd cast money into the treasury; and many rich were casting in much.
And one poor widow having come, cast in two lepta, which is a kodrantes.
And having summoned His disciples, He says to them, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast in more than all of those casting into the treasury.
For all cast in out of that which was abounding to them, but she out of her poverty cast in all, as much as she had of her whole livelihood.”
And of Him going forth out of the temple, one of His disciples says to Him, “Teacher, behold what stones and what buildings!”
And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left here upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down.”
And of Him sitting upon the Mount of Olives, opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him in private,
“Tell us when these things will be, and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be accomplished?”
And Jesus began to say to them, “Take heed, lest anyone mislead you.
Many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and they will mislead many.
And when you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be disturbed. It must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.
But you take heed to yourselves. They will betray you to courts, and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings because of Me, for a testimony to them.
And the gospel it behooves first to proclaim to all the nations.
But when they might lead you away, delivering you up, do not be anxious beforehand what you should say; but whatever might be given to you in that hour, speak that. For you are not those speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father, child; and children will rise up against parents, and will put them to death.
And you will be hated by all on account of My name; but the one having endured to the end, he will be saved.
And when you see the abomination of the desolation, standing where it should not (the one reading, let him understand), then those in Judea, let them flee to the mountains;
and the one upon the housetop, let him not come down nor go in to take anything out of his house;
and the one in the field, let him not return to the things behind to take his clothing.
And woe to those having in womb and to the ones nursing infants in those days!
And pray that it might not be in winter,
for in those days will be tribulation, the like such as never has been from the beginning of creation which God created until now—and never shall be.
And if the Lord had not shortened the days, not any flesh would have been saved; but on account of the elect whom He chose, He has shortened the days.
And then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ! Behold, there!’ you shall not believe it.
For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, the elect.
But you take heed; I have foretold to you all things.
But in those days, those after the tribulation, ‘The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;
and the stars will be falling out of the heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.’
And then will they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
